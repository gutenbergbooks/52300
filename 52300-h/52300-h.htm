<h1>WILLIAM BLAKE</h1>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Preliminary observations&mdash;Blake’s Birth&mdash;Education&mdash;Marriage&mdash;Early Poems&mdash;Drawings
and Engravings.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The position of William Blake among artists is exceptional. Of no
other painter of like distinction, save Dante Rossetti, can it be said
that his fame as a poet has fully rivalled his fame as a painter;
much less that, in the opinion of some, his fame as a seer ought
to have exceeded both. Many painters, from Reynolds downwards, have
written admirably upon art; in some instances, notably Haydon’s, the
worth of their precepts greatly exceeds that of their performance. But,
Rossetti always excepted, perhaps no other painter of great distinction,
save Michael Angelo alone, has achieved high renown in poetry, and the
compass of Michael Angelo’s poetical work is infinitesimal in comparison
with his work as an artist. Again, the literary achievements of an Angelo
or a Reynolds admit of clear separation from their performances as artists.
The critic who approaches them from the artistic side may, if he pleases,
omit the literary side entirely from consideration. This is impossible
with Blake, for not only do the artistic and the poetical monuments of
his genius nearly balance each other in merit and in their claim upon the
attention of posterity, but they are the offspring of the same creative
impulse, and are indissolubly fused together by the process adopted for
their execution. A study of Blake, therefore, must include more literary
discussion than would be allowable in a monograph on any other artist.
The poet and painter in Blake, moreover, are but manifestations of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
more comprehensive character of seer, which suggests inquiries alien to
both these arts; while the personal character of the man is so fascinating,
and his intellectual character so perplexing, that the investigation of either
of them might afford, and often has afforded, material for a prolonged
discussion. In the following pages it will be our object, whenever compelled
to quit the safe ground of biographical narrative, to subordinate all
else to the consideration of Blake as an artist; but the Blake of the brush
is too emphatically the Blake of the pen to be long dissociated from him,
and neither can be detached from the background of abnormal visionary
faculty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>From a certain point of view, artists may be regarded as divisible into
three classes: those who regard the material world as an unquestionable solid
reality, whose accurate representation is the one mission of Art; those to
whom it is a mere hieroglyphic of an essential existence transcending it;
and those who, uniting the two conceptions, are at the same time idealists
and realists. The greatest artists generally belong to the latter class, and
with reason, for a literal adherence to matter of fact almost implies defect
of imagination; while an extravagant idealism may be, to say the least,
a convenient excuse for defects of technical skill. It is difficult to know
whether to class the works of the very greatest artists as realistic or
idealistic. Take Albert Dürer’s <i>Melancholia</i>. It is a hieroglyph, a
symbol, an expression of something too intense to be put into words; a
delineation of what the painter beheld with the inner eye alone. Yet
every detail is as correct and true to fact as the most uninspired Dutchman
could have made it. Take Titian’s <i>Bacchus and Ariadne</i>, and
observe how separate details which the artist may have actually noticed,
are combined into a whole which has never been beheld, save by the
spiritual vision, since the last thyrsus was brandished by the last Mænad.
Yet, though the creators of such scenes are the greatest, some realists,
such as Velasquez, have in virtue of surpassing technical execution asserted
a nearly equal rank. The case is different when we come to the enthusiasts
and visionaries, whose art is wholly symbolic, who have given us
little that can be enjoyed as art for art’s sake, without reference to the
ideas of which it is made the vehicle. In many very interesting artists, such
as Wiertz and Calvert and Vedder, and in many isolated works of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
masters, such as Giorgione’s <i>Venetian Pastoral</i>, the feeling is so much in
excess of the execution&mdash;admirable as this may be&mdash;that the result is
rather a poem than a picture. But only one artist who has deliberately
made himself the prophet of this tendency, who has avowedly and defiantly
discarded all purpose from his works save that of spiritual
suggestiveness, seems to have ever been admitted as a candidate for very
high artistic honours, and he is our countryman, William Blake.</p>

<p>This circumstance alone should render Blake an interesting object of
study, even for those who can see no merit in his works: indeed, the less
the merit the more remarkable the phenomenon. He is, moreover, a most
peculiar and enigmatical character, both intellectually and morally. As
an art critic he is of all the most dogmatic, trenchant, and revolutionary.
As a poet, were nineteen-twentieths of his compositions to be discarded
as rubbish, lyrics would remain not only exquisite in themselves, but
possessing the incommunicable and Sapphic quality that a single stanza,
even a single phrase, would often suffice to make the writer immortal.
The question of his sanity is as well adapted to furnish the world with
an interminable subject of discussion as the execution of Charles I. or
the assassination of Cæsar. Finally, it is very significant that while no
man ever wilfully put more obstacles into the way of his success than
Blake, whether as artist, thinker, or poet, and he did in fact succeed in
condemning himself to poverty and obscurity, the verdict of his contemporaries
is now so far reversed that the drawings which a kind friend
overpaid, as he thought, at fifty guineas, are worth a thousand pounds.</p>

<p>What manner of man was he to whose shade the world has made this
practical apology?</p>

<p>William Blake was born on November 28th,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> 1757, at 28, Broad
Street, Golden Square. By a singular coincidence this was the very year
which a still more celebrated mystic, Swedenborg, had announced as that
of the Last Judgment in a spiritual sense, which was by no means to preclude
the world from going on in externals pretty much as usual. Blake’s
father, James Blake, was a hosier in moderately prosperous circumstances,
whose father is stated by Blake’s most elaborate commentators, Messrs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>Ellis and Yeats, to have been originally named O’Neil, and to have
assumed his wife’s name as a means of escape from pecuniary difficulties.
This wife, however, was not the mother of James. This genealogy is
not supported by any strong authority, and is at variance with another,
also indifferently supported, according to which the artist’s family were
connected with the admiral’s. We must leave the question where we find
it, merely remarking that Blake’s parents were certainly Protestants, and
that we can detect no specifically Irish trait in his character or his works.
He had three brothers&mdash;one, James, mild and unassuming like his father;
another, Robert, who died young, apparently with more affinity to
William; the third, John, a scapegrace. There was also a sister who
never married, and is described as a thorough gentlewoman, reserved
and proud. None of the family except William and Robert seem to
have shown any artistic talent. With William it must have been
precocious, for, ere he had attained the age of ten, his father, who as a
small tradesman might rather have been expected to have thwarted the
boy’s inclinations, placed him at “Mr. Pars’ drawing school in the
Strand.” Here he learned to draw from plaster casts&mdash;the life was denied
him&mdash;and with the aid of his father and a friendly auctioneer collected
prints, then to be picked up cheap, showing from the very first, as he
afterwards related, a complete independence of the pseudo-classic taste of
the day. At four he had had his first vision, when “God put his forehead
to the window, which set him screaming.” At eight or ten he saw
a tree filled with angels, and angelic figures walking among haymakers.
“The child is father to the man.”</p>

<p>At the age of fourteen Blake was apprenticed to the engraver Basire.
Ryland had been thought of, but Blake, according to a story which he
must have narrated, but may not improbably have imagined, demurred,
declaring that the fashionable engraver looked as if he would one day be
hanged, as he actually was. Basire’s practice lay chiefly in engraving
antiquities, and the last five years of Blake’s apprenticeship were chiefly
spent in drawing tombs and architectural details in Westminster Abbey
a most advantageous discipline, which imbued his mind with the Gothic
spirit, an influence already in the air, evincing itself in Götz von
Berlichingens, Rowley Poems, Percy Relics, and Castles of Otranto;
and, by directing him to English history and Shakespeare, powerfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
stimulated and felicitously guided the poetical genius of which he was
shortly to give proof. He drew, Malkin tells us, the monuments of kings
and queens in every point of view he could catch, frequently standing on
them. The heads he considered as portraits, and all the ornaments
appeared as miracles of art to his Gothicised imagination. Nor could a
better environment for a mystic be desired than the venerable and
generally solitary temple, “the height, the space, the gloom, the glory,”
with its music, its memories, and its constant sense of the presence of the
dead. The bent of his mind at the time is shown by his first engraving,
<i>Joseph of Arimathea among the Rocks of Albion</i>, copied, as he states, from
a scarce Italian print. If this was indeed the case, it may be queried
whether the title at least was not his&mdash;Joseph, according to the legend,
having been the first missionary to Britain. The original, if original
there was, certainly was not the work of Michael Angelo, to whom Blake
chose to attribute it. Scarcely was he out of his articles than he produced
(1779) two engravings from the history of England, <i>The Penance
of Jane Shore</i> and <i>King Edward and Queen Eleanor</i>. These were after
two water-colour drawings, selected from a much greater number with
which he had amused the leisure hours of his apprenticeship. Mr.
Gilchrist says that these and other works of the period have little of the
peculiar Blakean quality, except the striking design <i>Morning, or Glad
Day</i>, dated 1780, a facsimile of which is given here. This, indeed, is
Blake all over, and would have made an excellent frontispiece for the
poems with which he was about to herald the dawn of a new era in
English poetry, though in all probability designed as an illustration of
the lines in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p class="noindent">A naked Apollo-like figure, wearing the dawn for a halo, in whom one
fancifully traces a resemblance to Goethe, alights throbbing with joy
and victory on the peak of a mountain, while the waning moon, as
would seem, sets behind him, and a winged beetle scuds away.</p>

<p>The poems to which reference has been made had meanwhile been
slowly accumulating; if the language of the advertisement which
heralded their publication is to be taken literally, they were now complete.
Before appearing as a poet, however, Blake had to undergo his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
probation as a lover. He became enamoured of a pretty girl variously
called Polly or Clara Woods. She rejected him. He fell into a
melancholy, and was sent to Richmond for change of air. There he
lodged with a nursery gardener named Boucher. The daughter of the
house, Catherine, had been frequently asked whom she would like to
marry, and had always replied that she had not seen the man. Coming
on the night of Blake’s arrival into the room where he was sitting with
the rest of the family, she grew faint from the presentiment that she
beheld her destined husband. On subsequently hearing of his disappointment
with Clara Woods, she told him that she pitied, and he told her
that he loved. They were married on August 18, 1782, Blake having,
it is said, proved their mutual constancy by refraining from seeing her
for a year, while he was toiling to save enough to render their marriage
not utterly imprudent. His first care afterwards was to teach her to
read and write, to which he afterwards added enough of the pictorial art
to enable her to colour his drawings. A more devoted wife never lived,
though her devotion wore in the eyes of strangers an aspect of formality,
and was always tinged with awe.</p>

<p><i>Poetical Sketches</i>, 1783, were the first-fruits of Blake’s genius,
composed, as asserted in the advertisement prefixed by his friends,
between 1768 and 1777.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> They are the only examples of his literary
work devoid of artistic illustration; we ought not, consequently, to
spend much time upon them, yet they are the most memorable of his
works, for they are nothing short of miraculous, and alone among his productions
mark an era. For a hundred and thirty years English poetry
had been mainly artificial, the product of conscious effort ranging down
from the superb art of <i>Paradise Lost</i> to the prettinesses of Pope’s
imitators, but seldom or never wearing the aspect of a spontaneous
growth. This young obscure engraver was the first to show that it was
still possible to sing as the bird sings; he and no other was the morning
star which announced the new day of English poetry. Had even the
verses been of inferior quality, such inspiration would have sufficed for
fame, but Blake is as exquisite as original, and warbles such nightingale
notes as England had not heard since Andrew Marvell forsook song for
satire. The songs of Dryden, indeed, have great merit, but how they
savour of the study compared with the artless melody of a strain like
this!</p>

<p class="noindent">This is such a song as Marlowe might have written, but for a delicate
eighteenth-century suggestion in the style, whose aroma is not quite that
of the Elizabethan era. It is none the less one of the pieces which none
but Blake could have produced. The characteristics of his style, indeed,
are much less apparent in this early volume than in his subsequent
productions. They are most conspicuous in the <i>Mad Song</i>, but a more
pleasing if less intense example is the following:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Not the least remarkable of the <i>Poetical Sketches</i> are “Samson” and
other short pieces in blank verse. They are marvellously Tennysonian;
if imitation there was, it obviously was not on Blake’s part. Who would
have hesitated to ascribe these lines, addressed to the Evening Star, to the
Laureate?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">Let thy west wind sleep on</div>
<div class="verse">The lake; speak silence with thy glimmering eyes,</div>
<div class="verse">And wash the dusk with silver.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Even more marvellous than the sentiment is the metre, which cannot be
judged by a short passage. Well might it be said, “Thou hast hid
these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them unto babes,”
when the secret of melodious blank verse, withheld since the Civil
War from all the highly cultured and in many respects highly gifted
bards of England, is disclosed on the sudden to this half-educated
young man. It is exemplified on a larger scale by the accompanying
fragments of an intended tragedy on <i>Edward the Third</i>, which proves
two things: first, that Blake was destitute of all dramatic faculty;
secondly, that, notwithstanding, few have so thoroughly assimilated
Shakespeare. Shakespeare stands almost alone among great poets in
having had hardly any direct imitators. Every one, of course, has profited
by the study of his art; but those most deeply indebted to him in this
respect have felt the least disposed to reproduce his style. The reason is
evident. Other writers are partial, Shakespeare is universal; the model
is too vast for study. A deliberate imitation of Shakespeare would
assuredly be a failure: imitation is only practicable when it is not
deliberate but unconscious, the effluence of a mind so saturated with
Shakespeare that it can for the time only express itself in Shakespearian
numbers, and think under Shakespearian forms. Blake must have been in
such a situation when he attempted <i>Edward the Third</i>, the direct fruit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
of his roamings among the regal tombs in the Abbey with Shakespeare’s
historical plays in his hand. The drama is childish, but the feeling
approaches Shakespeare as nearly as Keats’s early poems approach Spenser.
The imitation, being spontaneous and unsought, is never senile, but
every line reveals a youth whose soul is with Shakespeare, though his
body may be in Golden Square. Yet the reproduction of Shakespeare’s
manner is never so exact as to conceal the fact that the poet is writing in
the eighteenth and not in the sixteenth century. The following passage
may serve as an example both of the closeness of Blake’s affinity with
Shakespeare and of the <i>nuances</i> of difference that serve to vindicate his
originality.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">Last night beneath</div>
<div class="verse">The moon I walked abroad when all had pitched</div>
<div class="verse">Their tents, and all were still.</div>
<div class="verse">I heard a blooming youth singing a song</div>
<div class="verse">He had composed, and at each pause he wiped</div>
<div class="verse">His dropping eyes. The ditty was “If he</div>
<div class="verse">Returned victorious he should wed a maiden</div>
<div class="verse">Fairer than snow and rich as midsummer.”</div>
<div class="verse">Another wept, and wished health to his father.</div>
<div class="verse">I chid them both, but gave them noble hopes.</div>
<div class="verse">These are the minds that glory in the battle,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">This is beautiful description, sentiment and metre, but these beauties
sum up the attractions of Blake’s dramatic fragment. The dramatic
element is wanting, there is no action. This deficiency runs through his
whole work, pictorial as well as literary, and explains why one capable of
such sublime conceptions was nevertheless incapable of taking rank with
the Miltons and Michael Angelos. His productions are full of
tremendous scenes, the strivings and agonies of colossal unearthly powers
realised by his own mind with a vividness which proves the intensity of
his conceptions. Yet he seldom impresses the beholder with any
sentiment of awe or terror. The cause is not solely the fantastic
character of these conceptions, for the effect is the same when he deals
with mankind, and represents it in the most thrilling crises of which
humanity is capable. His representation of the plague, for instance,
engraved in Gilchrist’s biography, excites strong interest and curiosity,
but nothing of the shuddering dismay with which we should view such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
scene in actual life, and which is so powerfully conveyed in such works
as Géricault’s <i>Wreck of the Medusa</i> and Poole’s <i>Solomon Eagle</i>. The
reason seems to be that Blake was not only a visionary but also a mystic,
and that mysticism is hardly compatible with tragic passion. The
visionary, as in the instances of Dante and Bunyan, may realise every
detail of his ideal conceptions with the force of actual perception, but it
is the very essence of the mystic’s creed that things are not what they
seem, and the man who knows himself to be depicting a hieroglyphic will
never grasp his subject with the force of him who feels that he is dealing
with a concrete reality. The Hindoos are a nation of mystics who
regard existence as an illusion, and their art labours under the same
defects as Blake’s; their drama especially, with all the charm of lovely
arabesque, makes nothing of the strongest situations, save when these are
of the pathetic order. For although the mystic cannot be exciting, he
can be tender: and while Blake’s efforts at the delineation of frantic
passion or overwhelming catastrophes usually (there are exceptions)
leave us unmoved, nothing can be more pathetic than some of his
delineations, such, for example, as the famous illustration to Blair, of
an old man approaching the grave.</p>

<p>It seems almost strange that verses, as contrary to the spirit of the
age that gave them birth as prophetic of the ideals of the age to come,
should have found friends willing to defray their cost. If, however, it is
true that Flaxman was among these friends, Blake had met with one congenial
spirit. A clergyman named Matthews, incumbent of Percy Chapel,
Charlotte Street, is mentioned as another patron, and as the writer of
the well-meaning but too apologetic preface. Through him Blake seems
to have become acquainted with Flaxman. To the few then able to
appreciate the poems, they might well have seemed indicative of a great
poetical career, for they are exactly the sweet, wild, untaught, prelusive
music wherewith youth, as yet unschooled by criticism and unawakened
to its really profound problems, is wont to essay its art. Why was it
that Blake, though rivalling these early attempts in his <i>Songs of Innocence</i>
and <i>Songs of Experience</i>, never progressed further; and in by far the
greater part of his subsequent poetry went off altogether upon a wrong
track, so far at least as concerned poetry? Partly, we think, because his
mind was almost entirely deficient in the plastic element. He could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
reproduce a scene ready depicted for him, as in his illustrations to Job;
he could embody a solitary thought with exquisite beauty, whether in
poetry or in painting; but he could not combine his ideas into a whole.
His faculty was purely lyrical, and when this evanescent endowment
forsook him, devoid as he was of all plastic literary power, he had no
Oenone or Ulysses to replace his Claribels and Eleanores. His verse
became a mere accompaniment of his pictorial art, and harmonising with
its vagueness and obscurity, necessarily lacked the symmetry with which
a colourist can dispense, but which is essential to a poet. Even more
remarkable than the music of Blake’s early verses, unparalleled in their
age, is the fact, vouched for by J. T. Smith, the biographer of Nollekens
and Keeper of Prints at the British Museum, that he had composed tunes
for them, which he could only repeat by ear from his ignorance of
musical notation. Some of these, Smith says, were exquisitely beautiful.</p>

<p>At the appearance of the <i>Poetical Sketches</i> (1783), Blake had for a
year been a married man, and was actively striving to make a living as
an engraver. Most of his work of this nature at this time was executed
after Stothard. It cannot be disputed that this graceful artist largely
influenced Blake’s style in its more idyllic aspects; whether, as he was
afterwards inclined to assert, Stothard’s invention owed something to him
is not easy to determine. In 1784 he lost his father, a mild, pious man,
who had well performed his duty to his son. Blake’s elder brother James
took his business, and the artist, who had probably inherited some little
property, returned from Green Street to Broad Street, and, establishing
himself next door to his brother, launched into speculation as a print-seller
in partnership with a former fellow apprentice named Parker, taking
his brother Robert as a gratuitous pupil. In 1785 he sent four drawings
to the Academy. Three, illustrative of the story of Joseph, were shown
in the International Exhibition of 1862, and are described by Gilchrist as
“full of soft tranquil beauty, specimens of Blake’s earlier style; a very
different one from that of his later and better-known works.” This is
probably as much as to say that he then wrought much under the influence
of Stothard, after whom he engraved the subject from <i>David Simple</i>
given here; for the earlier design illustrative of the passage in <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i> is characteristically Blakean. Mr. Gilchrist adds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span> “the design
is correct and blameless, not to say tame (for Blake), the colour full,
harmonious and sober.” Mr. Rossetti says that the figure of Joseph,
in the third drawing, “is especially pure and impulsive.”</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Illustration from “David Simple.” Engraved by W. Blake after T. Stothard, R.A.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In 1787 Blake’s experiment in print-selling came to an end, through
disagreements, it is said, with his partner; but as neither appears to have
afterwards pursued the calling, it is probable that it had never been profitable.
Parker obtained some distinction as an engraver, chiefly after
Stothard, and died in 1805. In February, 1787, Blake had sustained
a severe loss in the death of his brother and pupil Robert. Blake
himself nursed the patient for some weeks, and when at last the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
came, it is not surprising that he should have beheld his brother’s spirit
“arise and clap its hands for joy.” Not long after, as he asserted, the
spirit appeared to him in a dream, and revealed to him that process of
printing from copper plates which, as we shall see, had the most decisive
influence upon his work as an artist. Writing to Hayley in 1800, he
says, “Thirteen years ago I lost a brother, and with his spirit I converse
daily and hourly in the spirit, and see him in remembrance in the regions
of my imagination. I hear his advice, and even now write from his
dictate.” “The ruins of Time,” he finely subjoins, “build mansions
in Eternity.”</p>

<p>From this time Blake’s sole assistant was his wife, whom he carefully
instructed, and who tinted many of the coloured drawings which henceforth
form the more characteristic portion of his work. After giving up
his business as a print-seller, he removed from Broad Street to 28, Poland
Street. Messrs. Ellis and Yeats conjecture that this may have been
to escape the blighting influence of his commercial brother next door,
but it is more probable that his venture had impoverished him, and that
he was obliged to give up housekeeping.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Blake’s Technical Methods&mdash;“Songs of Innocence” and “Songs of Experience”&mdash;Life in
Poland Street and in Lambeth&mdash;Mystical Poetry and Art.</i></p>

</div>

<p>It was during his residence in Poland Street that Blake first appeared
in that mingled character of poet and painter which marks him off so
conspicuously from other painters and other poets. Painting has often
been made the handmaid of poetry; it was Blake’s idea, without
infringing upon this relationship, to make poetry no less the handmaid
of painting by employing his verse, engraved and beautified
with colour, to enhance the artistic value of his designs, as well as to
provide them with the needful basis of subject. The same principle may
probably be recognised in those Oriental scrolls where the graceful
labour of the scribe is as distinctly a work of art as the illustration
of the miniaturist; but of these Blake can have known nothing.
Necessity was with him the mother of invention. Since the appearance
of <i>Poetical Sketches</i> he had written much that he desired to publish&mdash;but
how to pay for printing? So severely had he suffered by his
unfortunate commercial adventure that when at length, as he firmly
believed, the new process by which his song and his design could be
facsimiled together was revealed by his brother’s spirit in a dream, a
half-crown was the only coin his wife and he possessed between them in
the world. One shilling and tenpence of this was laid out in providing
the necessary materials.</p>

<p>The technical method to which Blake now resorted is thus described
by Mr. Gilchrist:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span> “It was quite an original one. It consisted of a species
of engraving in relief, both words and designs. The verse was written
and the designs and marginal embellishments outlined on the copper
with an impervious liquid, probably the ordinary stopping-out varnish
of engravers. Then all the white parts or lights, the remainder of the
plate that is, were eaten away with aquafortis or other acid, so that
the outline of letter and design was left prominent, as in stereotype.
From these plates he printed off in any tint, yellow, brown, blue, required
to be the prevailing or ground colour in his facsimiles; red he used for the
letterpress. The page was then coloured up by hand in imitation of the
original drawing with more or less variety of detail in the local hues.
He ground and mixed his water-colours himself on a piece of statuary
marble, after a method of his own, with common carpenter’s glue
diluted. The colours he used were few and simple: indigo, cobalt,
gamboge, vermilion, Frankfort-black freely, ultramarine rarely, chrome
not at all. These he applied with a camel’s-hair brush, not with a sable,
which he disliked. He taught Mrs. Blake to take off the impressions
with care and delicacy, which such plates signally needed; and also
to help in tinting them from his drawings with right artistic feeling; in
all of which tasks she, to her honour, much delighted. The size of the
plates was small, for the sake of economising copper, something under
five inches by three. The number of engraved pages in the <i>Songs of
Innocence</i> alone was twenty-seven. They were done up in boards by
Mrs. Blake’s hand, forming a small octavo; so that the poet and his
wife did everything in making the book, writing, designing, printing,
engraving,&mdash;everything except manufacturing the paper; the very ink,
or colour rather, they did make. Never before, surely, was a man so
literally the author of his own book.”</p>

<p class="caption">The Lamb. Infant Joy. <i>From Blake’s “Songs of Innocence.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>The total effect of this process is tersely expressed by Mr. Rossetti,
“The art is made to permeate the poetry.” It resulted in the publication
of <i>Songs of Innocence</i> in 1789, two years after its discovery or revelation.
Other productions, of that weird and symbolic character in which Blake
came more and more to delight, followed in quick succession. These will
claim copious notice, but for the present we may pass on to <i>Songs of
Experience</i>, produced in 1794, so much of a companion volume to <i>Songs
of Innocence</i> that the two are usually found within the same cover.
Neither attracted much attention at the time. Charles Lamb says: “I
have heard of his poems, but have never seen them.” He is, however,
acquainted with “Tiger, tiger,” which he pronounces “glorious.” The
price of the two sets when issued together was from thirty shillings to
two guineas&mdash;an illustration of the material service which Art can render<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
to Poetry when it is considered that, published simply as poems, they
would in that age have found no purchasers at eighteenpence. This price
was nevertheless absurdly below their real value, and was enhanced even
during the artist’s lifetime. It came to be five guineas, and late in his
life friends, from the munificent Sir Thomas Lawrence downwards, would
commission sets tinted by himself at from ten to twenty guineas as a
veiled charity.</p>

<p>Of the poems and illustrations in <i>Songs of Innocence</i> and <i>Songs of Experience</i>
Gilchrist justly declares that their warp and woof are formed in
one texture, and that to treat of them separately is like pulling up a
daisy by the roots out of the green sward in which it springs. One
essential characteristic inspires them both, and may be defined as childish
fearlessness, the innocent courage of the infant who puts his hand upon
the serpent and the cockatrice. Any one but Blake would have feared to
publish designs and verses apparently so verging upon the trivial, and
which indeed would have been trivial&mdash;and worse, affected&mdash;if the
emanation of almost any other brain, or the execution of almost any
other hand. Being his, their sincerity is beyond question, and they are a
valuable psychological document as establishing the possibility of a man
of genius and passion reaching thirty with the simplicity of a child.
Hardly anything else in literature or art, unless some thought in
Shakespeare, so powerfully conveys the impression of a pure elemental
force, something absolutely spontaneous, innocent of all contact with
and all influence from the refinements of culture. They certainly
are not as a rule powerful, and contrast forcibly with the lurid and
gigantic conceptions which if we did not remember that the same Dante
depicted <i>The Tower of Famine</i> and <i>Matilda gathering Flowers</i>, we could
scarcely believe to have proceeded from the same mind. Their impressiveness
proceeds from a different source; their primitive innocence and
simplicity, and the rebuke which they seem to administer to artifice and
refinement. Even great artists and inspired poets, suddenly confronted
with such pure unassuming nature, may be supposed to feel as the disciples
must have felt when the Master set the little child among them. No
more characteristic examples could have been given than “The Lamb”
and “Infant Joy” from <i>Songs of Innocence</i>, and “The Fly” and “The
Tiger” from <i>Songs of Experience</i> selected for reproduction here from an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
uncoloured copy in the library of the British Museum. There is
frequently a great difference in the colouring of the copies. That in
the Museum Print Room is in full rich colour, while others are very
lightly and delicately tinted.</p>

</div>

<p>It is of course much easier to convey an idea of the merits of Blake’s
verse than of his painting, for the former loses nothing by transcription,
and the latter everything. The merit of the latter, too, is a variable
quantity, depending much upon the execution of the coloured plates.
The uncoloured are but phantoms of Blake’s ideas. The general
characteristics of his art in these books may be described as caressing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
tenderness and gentle grace, evinced in elegant human figures, frequently
drooping like willows or recumbent like river deities, and in sinuous
stems and delicate sprays, often as profuse as delicate. The foliated ornament
in “On Another’s Sorrow,” for instance, seems like a living thing,
and would almost speak without the aid of the accompanying verse.
The figures usually are too small to impress by themselves, and rather
seem subsidiary parts of the general design than the dominant factors.
They mingle with the inanimate nature portrayed, as one note of a
multitudinous concert blends with another. Yet “The Little Girl
Found” tells its story by itself powerfully enough; and the innocent
Bacchanalianism of the chorus in the “Laughing Song” is conveyed
with truly Lyæan spirit and energy.</p>

<p>The prevalent cheerfulness of the <i>Songs of Innocence</i> is of course
modified in <i>Songs of Experience</i>. The keynote of the former is admirably
struck in the introductory poem:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>This incarnate enigma among men could manifestly be as transparent
as crystal when he knew exactly what he wished to say&mdash;a remark which
may not be useless to the student of his mystical and prophetical
writings. The character of <i>Songs of Experience</i>, published in 1794, when
he had attained the age so often fatal to men of genius, is conveyed

<p class="caption">The Fly. The Tyger. <i>From Blake’s “Songs of Experience.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>Generally speaking, the <i>Songs of Experience</i> may be said to answer to
their title. They exhibit an awakening of thought and an occupation
with metaphysical problems alien to the <i>Songs of Innocence</i>. Such a
stanza as this shows that Blake’s mind had been busy:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Nought loves another as itself</div>
<div class="verse indent1">Nor venerates another so;</div>
<div class="verse">Nor is it possible to thought</div>
<div class="verse indent1">A greater than itself to know.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These ideas, however, are always conveyed, as in the remainder of
the poem quoted, through the medium of a concrete fact represented by
the poet. Perhaps the finest example of this fusion of imagination and
thought is this stanza of the most striking and best known of all the
poems, “The Tiger”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">When the stars threw down their spears</div>
<div class="verse">And watered heaven with their tears,</div>
<div class="verse">Did he smile his work to see?</div>
<div class="verse">Did He who made the lamb make thee?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">An evident, though probably unconscious, reminiscence of “When the
morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy,”
and like it for that extreme closeness to the inmost essence of things
which the author of the Book of Job enjoyed in virtue of the primitive
simplicity of his age and environment, and Blake through a childlike
temperament little short of preternatural in an age like ours. It may
be added, that although the pieces in <i>Songs of Innocence</i> and
<i>Songs of Experience</i> are of very unequal degrees of poetical merit, none
want the infallible mark of inspired poetry&mdash;spontaneous, inimitable
melody.</p>

<p>Both the simplicity and the melody, however, are absent from the
remarkable works with which Blake had been occupying himself during
the interval between the publication of the two series of his songs,
which, with their successors, have given him a peculiar and unique
reputation in their own weird way, but could not by themselves have
given him the reputation of a poet. Blake’s plain prose, as we shall see,
is much more effective. In a strictly artistic point of view, nevertheless,
these compositions reveal higher capacities than would have been inferred
from the idyllic beauty of the pictorial accompaniments of <i>Songs of
Innocence and Experience</i>. Before discussing these it will be convenient
to relate the chief circumstances of Blake’s life during the period of
their production, and up to the remarkable episode of his migration
to Felpham. They were not memorable or striking, but one of them
had considerable influence upon his development. In 1791 he was
employed by Johnson, the Liberal publisher of St. Paul’s Churchyard,
and as such a minor light of his time, to illustrate Mary Wollstonecraft’s
<i>Tales for Children</i> with six plates, both designed and engraved by him,
one of which accompanies this essay. They are much in the manner of
Stothard. This commission brought Blake as a guest to Johnson’s
house, where he became acquainted with a republican coterie&mdash;Mary
Wollstonecraft, Godwin, Paine, Holcroft, Fuseli&mdash;with whose political
opinions he harmonised well, though totally dissimilar in temperament
from all of them, except Fuseli, who gave him several tokens of
interest and friendship. These acquaintanceships, and the excitement
of the times, led Blake to indite, and, which is more extraordinary,
Johnson to publish, the first of an intended series of seven poetical
books on the French Revolution. This, Gilchrist tells us, was a thin
quarto, without illustrations, published without Blake’s name, and priced
at a shilling. Gilchrist probably derived this information from a
catalogue, for he carefully avoids claiming to have seen the book, which
seems to have also escaped the researches of all Blake’s other biographers.
It must be feared that it is entirely lost. Gilchrist must, however, have
known something more of it if his assertion that the other six books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
were actually written but not printed, “events taking a different turn
from the anticipated one,” is based upon anything besides conjecture.</p>

<p>In 1793 Blake removed from Poland Street to Hercules Buildings,
Lambeth, then a row of suburban cottages with little gardens. Here he
engraved his friend Flaxman’s designs for the <i>Odyssey</i>, to replace plates
engraved by Piroli and lost in the voyage from Italy, whence Flaxman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
had returned after seven years’ absence. In 1795 he designed three
illustrations for Stanley’s translation of Burger’s “Lenore,” and in 1796
executed a much more important work, 537 drawings for an edition
of Young’s <i>Night Thoughts</i> projected by a publisher named Edwards.
Forty-three were engraved and published in 1797, but the undertaking
was carried no further for want of encouragement, and the designs,
after remaining long in the publisher’s family, eventually came into the
hands of Mr. Bain of the Haymarket, who is still the possessor.
The most important are described by Mr. Frederic Shields in the
appendix to the second volume of Gilchrist’s biography. Mr. Shields’
descriptions are so fascinating<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> that from them alone one would be
inclined to rate the drawings very high: but Mr. Gilchrist thinks these
ill adapted for the special purpose of book illustration which they
were destined to subserve, and reminds us that the absence of colour is
a grave loss. Blake is said to have been paid only a guinea a plate
for the forty-three engravings, on which he worked for a year. The
Lambeth period, however, seems not to have been an unprosperous one,
for he had many pupils. Several curious anecdotes of it were related
after his death on the alleged authority of Mrs. Blake, but their
truth seems doubtful. It is certain that during this period he met
with the most constant of his patrons, Mr. Thomas Butts, who for
nearly thirty years continued a steady buyer of his drawings, and but
for whom he would probably have fallen into absolute distress.</p>

<p>It is now time to speak of the literary works&mdash;“pictured poesy,” like
the woven poesy of <i>The Witch of Atlas</i>&mdash;produced during this period.
In 1789, the year of publication of the <i>Songs of Innocence</i>, the series
opens with <i>Thel</i>. In 1790 comes <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i>; in
1793, <i>The Gates of Paradise</i>, <i>The Vision of the Daughters of Albion</i>, and
<i>America</i>; in 1794, <i>Europe</i>, <i>A Prophecy</i>, and <i>Urizen</i>; in 1795, <i>The Song
of Los</i>, and <i>The Book of Ahaniah</i>. In 1797 Blake seems to have written,
or to have begun to write, the mystical poem ultimately entitled <i>Vala</i>,
never published by him, and more than fifty years after his death found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>in Linnell’s possession in such a state of confusion that it took Messrs.
Ellis and Yeats days to arrange the MS., which they fondly deem to be
now in proper order. It is printed in the third volume of their work on
Blake. <i>Tiriel</i> is undated, but would seem to be nearly contemporary
with <i>Thel</i>.</p>

<p><i>The Gates of Paradise</i> constitutes an exception to the general spirit
of the works of this period, the accompanying text, though mystical
enough, being lyrical and not epical. The seventeen beautiful designs,
emblematical of the incidents necessarily associated with human nature,
are well described by Allan Cunningham as “a sort of devout dream,
equally wild and lovely.”</p>

<p>The merits of this remarkable series of works will always be a matter
of controversy. “Whether,” as Blake himself says, “whether this is
Jerusalem or Babylon, we know not.” It must be so, for they are purely
subjective, there is no objective criterion; they admit of comparison with
nothing, and can be tested by no recognised rules. In the whole compass
of human creation there is perhaps hardly anything so distinctively an
emanation of the mind that gave it birth. Visions they undoubtedly are,
and, as Messrs. Ellis and Yeats well say, they are manifestly not the
production of a pretender to visionary powers. Whatever Blake has here
put down, pictorially or poetically, is evidently a record of something
actually discerned by the inner eye. This, however, leaves the question
of their value still open. To the pictorial part, indeed, almost all are
agreed in attaching a certain value, though the warmth of appreciation is
widely graduated. But literary estimation is not only discrepant but
hostile; some deem them revelation, others rhapsody. The one thing
certain is the general tendency towards Pantheism which Mr. Swinburne
has made the theme of an elaborate essay. To us they seem an exemplification
of the truth that no man can serve two masters. Blake had
great gifts, both as poet and artist, and he aspired not only to employ
both, but to combine both in the same work. At first this was practicable,
but soon the artistic faculty grew while the poetical dwindled. Not
only did the visible speech of painting become more important to him
than the viewless accents of verse, but his poetry became infected with
the artistic method. He allowed a latitude to his language which he
ought to have reserved for his form and colour, and became as hieroglyphic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
in a speech where hieroglyphs are illegitimate as in one where they are
permissible. This is proved by the fact that the decline in the purity of
poetical form and in the perspicuity of poetical language proceed <i>pari
passu</i>. <i>Thel</i>, the earliest, is also both the most luminous and the most
musical of these pieces. Could Blake have schooled himself to have
written such blank verse as he had already produced in <i>Edward the Third</i>
and <i>Samson</i>, <i>Thel</i> would have been a very fine poem. Even as it is its
lax, rambling semi-prose is full of delicate modulations:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The daughters of the Seraphim led round their sunny flocks,</div>
<div class="verse">All but the youngest; she in paleness sought the secret air</div>
<div class="verse">To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day.</div>
<div class="verse">Down by the river of Adera her soft voice is heard,</div>
<div class="verse">And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>In every succeeding production, however, there is less of metrical
beauty, and thought and expression grow continually more and more
amorphous. Blake may not improbably have been influenced by Ossian,
whose supposed poems were popular in his day, and from whom some of
his proper names, such as Usthona, seem to have been adopted. Many
then deemed that Ossian had demonstrated form to be a mere accident of
poetry instead of, as in truth it is, an indissoluble portion of its essence.
There is certainly a strong family resemblance between Blake’s shadowy
conceptions and Ossian’s misty sublimities. On the other hand, he
may be credited with having made a distinguished disciple in Walt
Whitman, who would not, we think, have written as he did if Blake
had never existed. What was pardonable in one so utterly devoid
of the sentiment of beautiful form as Whitman, was less so in one so
exquisitely gifted as Blake. Both derive some advantages from their
laxity, especially the poet of Democracy, but both suffer from the inability
of poetry, divorced from metrical form, to take a serious hold upon the
memory. One reads and admires, and by and by the sensation is of the
passage of a great procession of horsemen and footmen and banners, but
no distinct impression of a single countenance.</p>

<p>The general effect of these strange works upon the average mind
is correctly expressed by Gilchrist, when he says, speaking of <i>Europe</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span> “It
is hard to trace out any distinct subject, any plan or purpose, or to determine
whether it mainly relates to the past, the present, or things to come.
And yet its incoherence has a grandeur about it as of the utterance of a
man whose eyes are fixed on strange and awful sights, invisible to bystanders.”
What, then, did Blake suppose himself to behold? Messrs.
Ellis and Yeats have devoted an entire volume of their three-volume
work on Blake to the exposition of his visions. Their comment is often
highly suggestive, but it is seldom convincing. When the right interpretation
of a symbol has been found, it is usually self-evident.
Not so with their explanations, which appear neither demonstrably
wrong nor demonstrably right. Not that Blake talked aimless
nonsense; we are conscious of a general drift of thought in some
particular direction which seems to us to offer a general affinity
to the thought of the ancient Gnostics. It would be interesting
if some competent person would endeavour to determine whether the
resemblance goes any deeper than externals. Blake certainly knew
nothing of the Gnostics at first hand, nor is it probable that he could
have gained any knowledge of them from the mystical writers he did
study, Behmen and Swedenborg. But similar tendencies will frequently
incarnate themselves in individuals at widely remote periods of the world’s
history without evidence of direct filiation. Even so exceptional a
personage as Blake cannot be considered apart from his age, and his age,
among its other aspects, was one of mesmerism and illuminism. The
superficial resemblance of his writings to those of the Gnostics is certainly
remarkable. Both embody their imaginations in concrete forms; both
construct elaborate cosmogonies and obscure myths; both create hierarchies
of principalities and powers, and equip their spiritual potentates with
sonorous appellations; both disparage matter and its Demiurgus. “I
fear,” said Blake to Robinson, “that Wordsworth loves nature, and
nature is the work of the devil. The devil is in us as far as we are
nature.” The chief visible difference, that the Gnostics’ philosophy
tends to asceticism, and Blake’s to enjoyment, may perhaps be explained
by the consideration that he was a poet, and that they were philosophers
and divines. Perhaps the best preparation for any student of Blake who
might wish to investigate this subject further would be to read the article
in the <i>Dictionary of Christian Biography</i> upon the <i>Pistis Sophia</i>, the only
Gnostic book that has come down to us, and one which Blake would have
delighted in illustrating. The Gnostic belief in the all-importance of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
transcendent knowledge which comes of immediate perception (γνῶσις)
reappears in him with singular intensity. “Men are admitted into
heaven,” he says, “not because they have curbed and governed their
passions, or have no passions, but because they have cultivated their
understandings. The fool shall not enter into heaven, let him be ever so
holy.” Nothing in Blake, perhaps, is so Gnostic as the strange poem, <i>The
Everlasting Gospel</i>, first published by Mr. Rossetti, though many things
in it would have shocked the Gnostics.</p>

<p class="caption">TITLE PAGE FROM THE BOOK OF THEL.</p>

</div>

<p>The strictly literary criticism of Blake’s mystical books may be almost
confined to the <i>Book of Thel</i>, for this alone possesses sufficient symmetry
to allow a judgment to be formed upon it as a whole. The others are
like quagmires occasionally gay with brilliant flowers; but <i>Thel</i>, though
its purpose may be obscure, is at all events coherent, with a beginning
and an end. Thel, “youngest daughter of the Seraphim,” roves through
the lower world lamenting the mortality of beautiful things, including
her own. All things with which she discourses offer her consolation,
but to no purpose. At last she enters the realm of Death himself.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">The eternal gates’ terrific porter lifted the northern bar;</div>
<div class="verse">Thel entered in and saw the secrets of the land unknown.</div>
<div class="verse">She saw the couches of the dead, and where the fibrous root</div>
<div class="verse">Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists:</div>
<div class="verse">A land of sorrows and of tears, where never a smile was seen.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">She wandered in the land of clouds, through valleys dark listening</div>
<div class="verse">Dolours and lamentations; waiting oft beside a dewy grave</div>
<div class="verse">She stood in silence, listening to the voices of the ground,</div>
<div class="verse">Till to her own grave-plot she came, and there she sat down,</div>
<div class="verse">And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The effect of the voice of sorrow upon Thel is answerable to that of
the spider upon little Miss Muffet. This abrupt conclusion injures the
effect of a piece which otherwise may be compared to a strain of soothing
music, suggestive of many things, but giving definite expression to none.
Messrs. Ellis and Yeats, however, have no difficulty in assigning a
meaning. Thel, according to them, is “the pure spiritual essence,” her
grief is the dread of incarnation, and her ultimate flight is a return “to
the land of pure unembodied innocence from whence she came.” Yet her
forsaking this land is represented as her own act, and it is difficult to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
how she could have “led round her sunny flocks” in it if she had not
been embodied while she inhabited it. At the same time, if Messrs.
Ellis and Yeats are right, no interpretation of Blake can be disproved
by any inconsistency that it may seem to involve. “The surface,”
they say, “is perpetually, as it were, giving way before one, and revealing
another surface below it, and that again dissolves when we try to
study it. The making of religions melts into the making of the earth,
and that fades away into some allegory of the rising and the setting of
the sun. It is all like a great cloud full of stars and shapes, through
which the eye seeks a boundary in vain.”</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Design from the “Book of Urizen.” By W. Blake.</i></p>

</div>

<p>Mr. Yeats, putting his interpretation of Blake’s symbolism more
tersely into the preface to his excellent edition of the Poetical Works,
describes it as shadowing forth the endless conflict between the Imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
and the Reason, which, we may add, the Gnostics would have
expressed as the strife between the Supreme Deity and the god of this
world, the very phrase which Mr. Yeats himself uses in describing
Urizen, Blake’s Evil Genius, “the maker of dead law and blind negation,”
contrasted as the Gnostics would have contrasted him with Los,
the deity of the living world. Blake, therefore, has points of contact
with the representatives of the French Revolution on one side, and with
Coleridge on the other. Mr. Yeats’s interpretation is in itself coherent
and plausible, but the question whether it can be fairly deduced from
Blake himself is one on which few are entitled to pronounce, and the causes
of Blake’s obscurity are not so visible as its consequences. To us, as
already said, much of it appears to arise from his imperfect discrimination
between the provinces of speech and of painting. His discourse frequently
seems a hieroglyphic which would have been more intelligible if it could
have been expressed in the manner proper to hieroglyphics by pictorial representation.
As Mr. Smetham says of some of the designs, “Thought
cannot fathom the secret of their power, and yet the power is there.” It
seems evident that the poem, when a complete lyric, generally preceded the
picture in Blake’s mind, and that the latter must usually be taken as a
gloss, in which he seeks to illustrate by means of visible representation
what he was conscious of having left obscure by verbal expression. The
exquisite song of the Sunflower, for example, certainly existed before the
very slight accompanying illustration.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Ah Sunflower, weary of time,</div>
<div class="verse">Who counted the steps of the sun,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeking after that sweet golden clime</div>
<div class="verse">Where the traveller’s journey is done.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Where the youth, pined away with desire,</div>
<div class="verse">And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,</div>
<div class="verse">Arise from their graves and aspire</div>
<div class="verse">Where my sunflower wishes to go.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The first of these stanzas is perfectly clear: the second requires no
interpretation to a poetical mind, but will not bear construing strictly,
and its comprehension is certainly assisted by the slight fugitive design
lightly traced around the border. Generally the pictorial illustration of
Blake’s thought is much more elaborate, but in <i>Songs of Innocence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Experience</i> it almost always seems to have grown out of the poem. In the
less inspired <i>Prophetical Books</i>, on the other hand, the pictorial representation,
even when present only to the artist’s mind, seems to have
frequently suggested or modified the text. An example may be adduced
from <i>The Book of Thel</i>.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Why an ear, a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in?</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Blake had noted the external likeness of the convolutions of the ear
to the convolutions of a whirlpool; therefore the ear shall be described
as actually being what it superficially resembles, and because the whirlpool
sucks in ships, the ear shall suck in creations. It must also be
remembered that Blake’s belief that his works were given him by
inspiration prevented his revising them, and that they were stereotyped
by the method of their publication. No considerable productions of the
human mind, it is probable, so nearly approach the character of
absolutely extemporaneous utterances.</p>

<p>Before passing from the literary to the artistic expression of Blake’s
genius in these books, something must be said of the remarkable
appendix to <i>The Marriage of Heaven and Hell</i> entitled <i>Proverbs of Hell</i>.
These are a number of aphoristic sayings, impregnated with Blake’s

sufficiently compatible with delusion on particular subjects. With
incomparable art, Shakespeare has imparted a touch of wildness to

have spoken if it had been possible for Polonius to speak in tropes.</p>

<p>From the difficult subject of the interpretation of Blake’s mystical
designs we pass with satisfaction to the artistic qualities of the designs
themselves. On this point there is an approximation to unanimity. To
some the sublime, to others the grotesque, may seem to preponderate,
but all will allow them to be among the most remarkable and original
series of conceptions that ever emanated from a mortal brain. To whatever
exceptions they may be liable, it enlarges one’s apprehension of the
compass of human faculties to know that human faculties have been
adequate to their production. They may be ranked with the most
imaginative passages of <i>Paradise Lost</i>, and of Byron’s <i>Cain</i> as an
endeavour of the mind to project itself beyond the visible and tangible,
and to create for itself new worlds of grandeur and of gloom in
height and abyss and interstellar space. Wonderful indeed is the range
of imagination displayed, even though we cannot shut our eyes to some
palpable repetitions. In the opinion, however, of even so sympathetic
a critic as Dr. Wilkinson, Blake deserves censure for having degenerated
into mere monstrosity. “Of the worst aspect of Blake’s genius,” he
says, “it is painful to speak. In his <i>Prophecies of America</i>, his <i>Visions
of the Daughters of Albion</i>, and a host of unpublished drawings, earth-born
might has banished the heavenlier elements of art, and exists
combined with all that is monstrous and diabolical. The effect of these
delineations is greatly heightened by the antiquity which is engraven
on the faces of those who do and suffer in them. We have the
impression that we are looking down into the hells of the ancient
people, the Anakim, the Nephilim, and the Rephaim. Their human
forms are gigantic petrifactions, from which the fires of lust and
intense selfish passion have long dissipated what was animal and vital,
leaving stony limbs and countenances expressive of despair and stupid
cruelty.” We, on the other hand, should rather criticise Blake for
having failed to be as appalling as he meant to be. His power, as it
seems to us, consisted rather in the vivid imagination than in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
actual rendering of scenes of awe and horror. Far inferior artists have
produced more thrilling effects of this sort with much simpler means.
It would be wrong to say that his visions appear unreal, but they do
appear at a remove from reality, a world seen through a glass darkly,
its phantasm rather than its portrait. This, however, only applies to the
inventions of Blake’s own brain, which, if we may judge by the moderate
development of the back head in Deville’s cast, lacked the force of the
animal propensities requisite for the portrayal of cruelty and horror.
He could render the conceptions of others with startling force&mdash;witness
the impressive delineation reproduced by us of the Architect of the
Universe at work with his compasses; and the simple pencil outline of
Nebuchadnezzar in Mr. Rossetti’s book, engraved by Gilchrist, where
the human quadruped creeps away with an expression of overwhelming
and horror-stricken dismay. This power of interpretation was to find
yet finer expression in the illustration of the Book of Job.</p>

<p>Blake’s technical defects are indicated by Messrs. Ellis and Yeats as
consisting mainly in imperfect treatment of the human form from want
of anatomical knowledge. He had always disliked that close study
of the life which alone could have made him an able draughtsman;
it “obliterated” him, he said, and had resolved to quarrel with almost
all the artists from whom he might have learned. It must be remembered
in his excuse that consummate colouring and consummate
draughtsmanship are seldom found associated. Those who may feel
disappointed with the reproductions of Blake’s mystical designs must also
remember that these are but shadows of the artist’s thought, which
needed for its full effect the application of colour by his own hand.
“Much,” says Dante Rossetti, “which seems unaccountably rugged and
incomplete is softened by the sweet, liquid, rainbow tints of the coloured
copies into mysterious brilliancy.” The effect thus obtained may perhaps
be best shown by Mr. Gilchrist’s eloquent description of the illuminated
drawings in Lord Crewe’s copy of <i>America</i>. “Turning over the leaves,
it is sometimes like an increase of daylight in the retina, so fair and
open is the effect of particular pages. The skies of sapphire, or gold,
rayed with hues of sunset, against which stand out leaf or blossom,
or pendent branch, gay with bright-plumaged birds; the strips of
emerald sward below, gemmed with flower and lizard, and enamelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
snake, refresh the eye continually. Some of the illustrations are of a
more sombre kind. There is one in which a little corpse, white as snow,
lies gleaming on the floor of a green over-arching cave, which close
inspection proves to be a field of wheat, whose slender interlacing stalks,
bowed by the full ear and by a gentle breeze, bend over the dead infant.
The delicate network of stalks, which is carried up one side of the page,
the main picture being at the bottom, and the subdued yet vivid green
light shed over the whole, produce a lovely decorative effect. Decorative
effect is, in fact, never lost sight of, even where the motive of the design
is ghastly or terrible.” Whatever the imperfections of Blake’s peculiar
sphere, it <i>was</i> his sphere, and probably the only department of art in which
he could have obtained greatness even if his technical accomplishment
had been as complete as it was the reverse. When painting on more
orthodox lines he is often surprisingly tame and conventional. How
remote he was from the inane when he could revel in his own conceptions
may, notwithstanding the tremendous disadvantages inherent in reproduction,
be judged from the illustrations to his mystical books selected
for this monograph, the frontispiece and Plate IV. of <i>Thel</i>, and the two
subjects from <i>America</i>.</p>

<p>Blake was now about to make a change in his external environment,
which would have been momentous to any artist whose themes had been
less exclusively discerned by the inner eye. It is an extraordinary fact,
but there is absolutely no evidence that the poet who “made a rural pen”
had as yet ever seen the country beyond the immediate neighbourhood
of London. It is vain to speculate upon the precise modification which
might have been wrought in his genius by rural nurture or foreign
travel. Now he was actually to become a denizen of the country for
some years. An introduction from Flaxman had made him acquainted
with William Hayley, a Sussex squire and scholar, now chiefly remembered
as his patron and the biographer of Cowper, but esteemed in his
own day as one of the best representatives of English poetry at what
seemed the period of its deepest decrepitude, though he is unaccountably
omitted in Porson’s catalogue of the bards of the epoch.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Hayley, having
lost his son, a pupil of Flaxman, and his friend Cowper within a week of
each other in the spring of 1800, resolved to solace his grief by writing
Cowper’s life, and suggested that Blake should live near him during the
progress of the work to execute the engravings by which it was to
be illustrated. In August, 1800, Blake removed from Lambeth to
Felpham, near Bognor, on the Sussex coast, where Hayley occupied a
marine villa, his own residence at Eastham being let on account of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>the embarrassment of his affairs. The cottage was not provided by him
for Blake, but the rent was paid by Blake himself. The change from
Lambeth to a beautiful country of groves, meadows, and cornfields,
with sails in the distance,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Half lost in the liquid azure bloom of a crescent of sea,</div>
<div class="verse">The shining sapphire-spangled marriage ring of the land,</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">affected Blake with enthusiastic delight. “Felpham,” he wrote to
Flaxman, “is a sweet place for study, because it is more spiritual than
London. Heaven opens here on all sides her golden gates; her windows
are not obstructed by vapours; voices of celestial inhabitants are more
distinctly heard, and their forms more distinctly seen, and my cottage is
also a shadow of their houses.” He continues: “I am more famed
in Heaven for my works than I could well conceive. In my brain are
studies and chambers with books and pictures of old, which I wrote
and painted in ages of eternity before my mortal life; and those works
are the delight and study of archangels. Why then should I be
anxious about the riches or fame of mortality?” It is clear that,
notwithstanding his theories of the deadness of the material creation,
Blake valued natural beauty as an instrument for bringing him into
more intimate connection with the visionary world. At first the
desired effect was fully produced. Blake began to compose, or rather,
according to his own account, to take down from supernatural
dictation the <i>Jerusalem</i>, the most important in some respects of his
mystical writings. Walking by the shore&mdash;the very shore where Cary was
afterwards to encounter Coleridge&mdash;he habitually met Moses and the
Prophets, Homer, Dante, and Milton. “All,” he said, “majestic
shadows, gray but luminous, and superior to the common height.”
A description so fine, that some may be inclined to deem it something
more than a mere fancy. Unfortunately he also fell in with a fairies’
funeral, a stumbling-block to the most resolute faith. By and by, however,
the dampness of the cottage proved provocative of rheumatism, and,
which was much more disastrous, the mental climate proved unsympathetic.
Hayley’s patronage of so strange a creature as he must have
thought Blake does him the highest honour. He appears throughout,
not only as a very kind man, but, what is less usual in a literary personage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a very patient one. He actually instructed Blake in Greek. His
kindness and patience did not, however, render him any the better poet;
he was an elegant <i>dilettante</i> at the best, and Blake must have chafed
at the obligation under which he felt himself to illustrate his verses. One
ballad of some merit, however, “Little Tom the Sailor,” inspired Blake
with a striking if somewhat rude design, and he adorned Hayley’s library
with ideal portraits of illustrious authors. The engraving work which he
had to execute for Hayley’s life of Cowper was also little to his taste,
but there seems no valid reason to charge him with neglect of it. His
own self-reproach, indeed, ran in quite a different channel: he accused
himself most seriously of unfaithfulness to his high vocation as a
revealer and interpreter of spiritual things. Absence from town
led him to write frequently to his friend and patron Butts, and these
letters are invaluable indications not only of the frame of his mind at the
time, but of its general habit. “I labour,” he says, “incessantly, I
accomplish not one-half of what I intend, because my abstract folly
hurries me often away while I am at work, carrying me over mountains
and valleys, which are not real, into a land of abstraction where spectres
of the dead wander. This I endeavour to prevent; I, with my whole
might, chain my feet to the world of duty and reality. But in vain! the
faster I bind, the lighter is the ballast; for I, so far from being bound
down, take the world with me in my flights, and often it seems lighter
than a ball of wool rolled by the wind.… If we fear to do
the dictates of our angels, and tremble at the tasks set before us, if
we refuse to do spiritual acts because of natural fears or natural desires,
who can describe the dismal torments of such a state?… Though
I have been very unhappy, I am so no longer. I have travelled through
perils and darkness not unlike a champion. I have conquered and shall
go on conquering. Nothing can withstand the fury of my course among
the stars of God and in the abysses of the accuser.” In plain English
Hayley strongly advised Blake to give up his mystical poetry and design
and devote himself solely to engraving, and Blake looked upon the
advice as a suggestion of the adversary. We do not know what Hayley
said. If he thought that one of the <i>Poetical Sketches</i> or the <i>Songs of
Innocence</i> was worth many pages of <i>Urizen</i> apart from the illustrations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
he had reason for what he thought. But Blake’s lyrical gift had all
but forsaken him; he was incapable of emitting “wood-notes wild,” and
the only way in which he could give literary expression to the inspiration
by which he justly deemed himself visited was through his rhythmical
form, which to Hayley may well have seemed monstrous. It is highly
probable that the pictorial part of Blake’s work found no more favour
with Hayley than the poetical; at all events it is very certain that
he greatly preferred his engraving, and wished Blake to follow the
art by which he had the best prospect of providing for himself. Johnson
and Fuseli, by Blake’s own admission, had given the same advice; and an
obscure line in one of his rather undignified and splenetic epigrams
against his well-intentioned friend may be interpreted as meaning that
Hayley had tried to bring his wife’s influence to bear upon him for
this end. In any case he lost temper with Hayley, and wrote to Butts
(July, 1803): “Mr. Hayley approves of my designs as little as he does
of my poems, and I have been forced to insist on his leaving me in both
to my own self-will; for I am determined to be no longer pestered with
his genteel ignorance and polite disapprobation. I know myself both
poet and painter, and it is not his affected contempt that can move to
anything but a more assiduous pursuit of both arts.” Two months
afterwards he returned to London, but on better terms with Hayley;
partly on account of the latter’s generous conduct in providing for his
defence against a charge of using seditious language, trumped up against
him by a soldier whom he had turned out of his garden. “Perhaps,”
he wrote to Butts, “this was suffered to give opportunity to those whom
I doubted to clear themselves of all imputation.” The case was tried
in January, 1804, and terminated in Blake’s triumphant acquittal. An
old man who had attended the trial as a youth said that he remembered
nothing of it except Blake’s flashing eye.</p>

</div>

<p>The engravings executed by Blake for Hayley during his residence
at Felpham were six for the life and letters of Cowper; four original
designs for ballads by Hayley, including “Poor Tom,” and six engravings
after Maria T. Flaxman for Hayley’s <i>Triumphs of Temper</i>. He did
some work for Hayley after his return to town&mdash;engravings for the <i>Life
of Romney</i>, and original designs for Hayley’s <i>Ballads on Animals</i>&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
corresponded with him in a friendly spirit, but the intimacy gradually
died away.</p>

<p>Blake was profoundly influenced by his residence at Felpham in one
respect; he became acquainted with opposition, and distinctly realised a
power antagonistic to his aspirations. He was thus stung into self-assertion,
and became hostile to the artists whose aims and methods he
was unable to reconcile with his ideas. The first hints of this attitude
appear in the praises he bestows upon the work of his own which chiefly
occupied him at Felpham, the <i>Jerusalem</i>. “I may praise it,” he says,
“since I dare not pretend to be any other than the secretary; the authors
are in eternity. I consider it as the grandest poem that this world contains.
Allegory addressed to the intellectual powers, while it is altogether
hidden from the corporeal understanding, is my definition of the most
sublime poetry.” Blake’s allegory so effectually eludes both the reason
and the understanding that Messrs. Ellis and Yeats frankly tell us that
it is not for a moment to be supposed that their own elaborate interpretation
will convey any idea to the mind unless it is read conjointly with
the poem; and if such is the commentary what must the text be? If
they are right the confusion is greatly increased by a wrong arrangement,
and by the numerous interpolations which Blake subsequently introduced
into the poem, which, though nominally issued in 1804, was not, they
think, actually completed until about 1820. It suffers from being
nearer prose than any of his former books. “When this verse was dictated
to me,” he says, “I considered a monotonous cadence, like that
used by Milton, Shakespeare, and all writers of English blank verse,
derived from the modern bondage of rhyming, to be a necessary and
indispensable part of the verse. But I soon found that in the mouth of
a true orator such monotony was not only awkward, but as much a
bondage as rhyme itself.” What can be said of the ears that could find
Shakespeare’s and Milton’s blank verse monotonous? The truth is that
Blake’s originally exquisite perception of harmony had waned with his
lyrical faculty, and he scoffs at what he is no longer able to produce. Yet
the general grandiose effect of <i>Jerusalem</i> is undeniable. Little as we can
attach any definite idea to it, it simultaneously awes and soothes like one
of the great inarticulate voices of nature, the booming of the billows, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the whisper of the winds in the wood. Occasionally we encounter some
beautiful little vignette like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">She creates at her will a little moving night and silence,</div>
<div class="verse">With spaces of sweet gardens and a tent of elegant beauty,</div>
<div class="verse">Closed in by sandy deserts, and a night of stars shining;</div>
<div class="verse">A little tender moon, and hovering angels on the wing,</div>
<div class="verse">And the male gives a time and revolution to her space</div>
<div class="verse">Till the time of love is passed in ever-varying delights:</div>
<div class="verse">For all things exist in the human imagination.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This seems an illustration of what we have said of the dependence of
Blake’s poetry upon his pictorial imagination, for it is clearly nothing but
a magnificent expansion of the midsummer night idyl of the glowworm
shining for her mate, “with her little drop of moonlight,” as Beddoes
beautifully says.</p>

<p>In artistic merit <i>Jerusalem</i> is fully equal to any of Blake’s works.
There is less of the grotesque than in the others, and even more of the
impressive. Much, however, depends upon the colouring, which varies
greatly in different copies. Mr. Gilchrist warns us that it cannot be
judged aright if we have not seen the “incomparable” copy in the
possession of Lord Crewe. “It is printed in a warm reddish-brown,
the exact colour of a very fine photograph; and the broken blending of
the deeper lines with the more tender shadows&mdash;all sanded over with a
sort of golden mist peculiar to Blake’s mode of execution&mdash;makes still
more striking the resemblance to the then undiscovered handling of
Nature herself.” The general character of the design is excellently
described by Gilchrist. “The subjects are vague and mystic as the poem
itself. Female figures lie among waves full of reflected stars: a strange
human image, with a swan’s head and wings, floats on water in a kneeling
attitude and drinks; lovers embrace in an open water-lily; an eagle-headed
creature sits and contemplates the sun; serpent-women are coiled
with serpents; Assyrian-looking, human-visaged bulls are seen yoked to
the plough or the chariot; rocks swallow or vomit forth human forms,
or appear to amalgamate with them; angels cross each other over wheels
of flame; and flames and hurrying figures wreathe and wind among the
lines.” It may indeed, like Blake’s other productions of the kind, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
described as a gigantic arabesque, imbued with a passion and pathos not
elsewhere attempted in this branch of art.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Design from “Milton.” By W. Blake.</i></p>

</div>

<p>The subject of <i>Milton</i>, from which one of our illustrations is selected,
is, in Mr. Swinburne’s words, the incarnation and descent into earth and
hell of Milton, who represents redemption by inspiration. Something
similar, as we have seen, is the idea of Blake’s fine mystical book, <i>Thel</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and the pilgrimage through a lower sphere is also found in the oldest
Assyrian poetry. The book, like <i>Jerusalem</i>, is dated 1804, but, like its
companion, must have been composed at Felpham. Nothing save actual
and present contact with country scenes could have inspired such a passage
as this, the crown of all Blake’s unrhymed poetry:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Thou hearest the nightingale begin the song of spring:</div>
<div class="verse">The lark sitting upon his earthly bed, just as the sun</div>
<div class="verse">Appears, listens silent: then springing from the wavy corn-field loud</div>
<div class="verse">He leads the choir of day: trill, trill, trill, trill:</div>
<div class="verse">Mounting upon the wings of light into the great expanse;</div>
<div class="verse">Re-echoing against the lovely blue and shining heavenly shell:</div>
<div class="verse">His little throat labours with inspiration, every feather</div>
<div class="verse">On throat and breast and wings vibrates with the effluence divine:</div>
<div class="verse">All nature listens silent to him, and the awful sun</div>
<div class="verse">Stands still upon the mountain looking on this little bird</div>
<div class="verse">With eyes of soft humility, and wonder, love, and awe.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Such a passage shows how greatly Blake might have gained as a poet
had he been more intimate with external nature. Very splendid lines
might be quoted from “Milton,” such as “A cloudy heaven mingled
with stormy seas in loudest ruin,” but they are glowing light upon a black
core of obscurity. Mr. Housman’s judgment applies to it as to all the
works of its class. “They are the sign chiefly of a beautiful nature
wasted for lack of equipment in formulating disputatively what grew
out of his better work with all the thoughtlessness and glory of a
flower.”<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>Several lyrical poems printed in Blake’s works may be assigned to
this date. Some, such as “The Crystal Cabinet” and “The Mental
Traveller,” are extremely mystical; others, such as “Mary,” are of
simply human interest; others, such as “Auguries of Innocence,” seem
little remote from nonsense. “The Everlasting Gospel” expresses his
profoundest ideas with startling crudity. None are wholly unmelodious,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>

<p>Blake, who had settled at 17, South Molton Street, Oxford Street,
was in the meantime dealing with a very different patron from Hayley,
Robert Cromek, a “stickit” engraver turned print-seller, who tricked if
he did not actually defraud him, but who is entitled to the credit of having
recognised his genius, and of having brought forward works of his more
adapted to attract public notice than anything he had yet done. These
were the twelve illustrations to Blair’s <i>Grave</i>, full of Blake’s peculiar
genius and at the same time intelligible to all. They had been executed
in 1804 and 1805. Cromek, who afterwards admitted that they were
worth sixty guineas, obtained them for twenty from the artist, who had
intended to publish them himself. It had been understood that Blake
should have engraved them, but Cromek, wisely from his own point of
view, but wrongfully as regarded Blake, intrusted the task to Schiavonetti.
As a frontispiece, they were accompanied by a portrait of Blake from a
drawing by Phillips, also engraved by Schiavonetti, which we have reproduced.
Thanks to Cromek’s judicious engineering, and the popularity
of the poem illustrated, the adventure proved a considerable success. “It
is the only volume with Blake’s name on the title-page,” says
Mr. Gilchrist, “which is not scarce.” The publication took place in 1808.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
In the interval Cromek, calling upon Blake, had seen a pencil sketch
of a design for the procession of Chaucer’s Canterbury Pilgrims.
Failing to obtain a finished drawing from the artist, who resented his previous
treatment, he proposed the subject to Stothard, withholding as apart
from all questions of Stothard’s “frigid and exemplary” character would
be most natural for him to do, all mention of Blake’s drawing. Stothard
accepted the commission; his elaborate oil picture was exhibited in 1807
with great success, but at the cost of a breach with Blake, who went so
far in his denunciation, not only of Cromek’s underhand dealing but of
the defects which he found in Stothard’s work, that when he afterwards
sought a reconciliation Stothard remained impervious. Determined to
vindicate his superiority, Blake completed, exhibited, and engraved his own
fresco. The exhibition, accompanied by a remarkable “descriptive
catalogue,” to which we shall return&mdash;was not the success it might have
been in the hands of the shrewd Cromek. The exhibition room was
watched by Blake’s brother James, whom Crabb Robinson asked whether
he should be allowed to come again free in consideration of having
bought four copies of the descriptive catalogue. “As long as you live,”
answered the overjoyed custodian. The success of the engraving was
proportionate to that of the exhibition; though it might have been
otherwise if the roughness of the original design had been smoothed down
by the deft Schiavonetti. “Blake’s production,” says Mr. Rossetti, “is
as unattractive as Stothard’s is facile; as hard and strong as Stothard’s is
limp; one face in Blake’s design means as much on the part of the artist,
and takes as much scrutiny and turning over of thought on the part of
the spectator, as all the pretty <i>fantoccini</i> and their sprightly little horses
in Stothard’s work.” The engraving of the <i>Pilgrimage</i> in Gilchrist’s
biography evinces the justice of this criticism; though Ellis and Yeats
rightly add that Blake has given all his personages the eyes of visionaries.
“A work of wonderful power and spirit, hard and dry, yet with grace,”
says Charles Lamb. The original fresco was purchased by Elijah’s raven,
the ever-ready Butts.</p>

<p>We must now return to the illustrations to Blair’s <i>Grave</i>, which are
not only the most popular of Blake’s works, but among his greatest.
He showed in general more vigour in dealing with the conceptions of
another than with his own, the latter imbibing an element of fanciful
grace from the gentle spirit which produced them. Hence <i>The Soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Exploring the Recesses of the Grave</i>, reproduced from <i>Thel</i>, though one of
the most poetical of the designs, is one of the least powerful. His
rendering of Blair’s thoughts is marvellously direct and impressive,
whether the passion depicted be joy, as in <i>The Reunion of the Soul and
the Body</i> (given here), or horror, as in <i>The Death of the Strong Wicked
Man</i>, or an intermediate shade, as in <i>The Soul hovering over the Body</i>.
None of these and few of the series, once seen, will easily be forgotten.
The most famous, and deservedly so, is the marvellous one, a combination
of two designs in <i>America</i> and <i>The Gates of Paradise</i>, where the aged
man, impelled by a strong wind, totters towards the portal of the
sepulchre, on the summit of which sits the rejuvenated spirit, personified
by a strong youth, rejoicing in his deliverance, but dazzled by the as
yet unwonted light. In all these designs the element of seemly, yet
slightly formal and conventional grace which Blake had learned from
Stothard, is very conspicuous. The least successful, as seems to us, is
<i>The Last Judgment</i>, where Blake appears as a minor Michael Angelo,
but this work as engraved differs widely from his description of the
work as exhibited. It may well be believed that the modified version
was distinguished by great splendour of colouring.</p>

<p>Other works of this period were two small frescoes exhibited at the
Academy in 1808, <i>Christ in the Sepulchre</i> and <i>Jacob’s Dream</i>; the
“ornamental device” engraved (by Cromek) along with the frontispiece
to Malkin’s <i>Father’s Memoirs of his Child</i>, a graceful and pathetic
composition; three illustrations to Shakespeare, one of which, the highly
imaginative conception of the appearance of the Ghost to Hamlet, is
engraved in Gilchrist’s biography; <i>The Babylonian Woman on the Seven-headed
Beast</i> (1809) reproduced here; a continuous series of designs
produced for Mr. Butts, to be mentioned more fully hereafter; and the
pictures displayed along with <i>The Canterbury Pilgrims</i> at its exhibition
(1809). We must now devote some attention to Blake’s appearance as
an æsthetic writer in the <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> he put forth on this
occasion, with which his other principal deliverances on the subject of art
may be advantageously grouped.</p>

</div>

<p>Blake’s <i>Descriptive Catalogue</i> and his <i>Appeal to the Public</i> to judge
between himself and his rivals in the department of engraving, are a
singular mixture of gold and clay. The dignity which characterised his
demeanour in life forsakes him as soon as he takes the pen into his hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
and he reviles Stothard, Woollett, and others in a strain inconsistent with
self-respect on his own part, even had his criticism been well founded.
As a matter of fact, it seems to have had no foundation, and assuredly
has not affected the reputation of his antagonists in the smallest degree.
At the same time it is impossible not to be moved by his earnestness.
He is evidently contending for principles of great importance to himself,
and through the mist of his confused and ungrammatical expression we
seem to catch glimpses of high and serious truth. A refreshing contrast
is afforded by the passages devoted to Chaucer, which are truly admirable
for their felicitous insight into the old poet. “For all who have read
Blake,” justly say Messrs. Ellis and Yeats, “Chaucer is something more
than the sweet spinner of rhyming gossip that he seems to most.” Like
Ruskin, and indeed all men of creative power, Blake is on much safer
ground when he extols than when he censures. To much the same
period belongs a remarkable paper on his <i>Last Judgment</i>, published by
Gilchrist from his MS. Nothing of his admits us so fully into the
sanctuary of his mind. “<i>The Last Judgment</i>,” he begins, “is not fable
or allegory, but vision. Fable, or allegory, is a totally distinct and inferior
kind of poetry. Vision, or imagination, is a representation of what
actually exists, really and unchangeably.” Then follows an extremely
graphic and vivid description of the painting, interspersed with profound
remarks, such as “Man passes on, but states remain for ever; he passes
through them like a traveller, who may as well suppose that the places
he has passed through exist no more as a man may suppose that the states
he has passed through exist no more; everything is eternal.” “I have
seen, when at a distance, multitudes of men in harmony appear like a
single infant.”<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> “In Hell all is self-righteousness; there is no such
thing there as forgiveness of sin. He who does forgive sin is crucified
as an abettor of criminals.” “Angels are happier than men and devils,
because they are not always prying after good and evil in one another,
and eating the tree of knowledge for Satan’s gratification.” “<i>The Last
Judgment</i> is an overwhelming of bad art and science.” Finally,
in words that state his own case as respects his reputed delusions, he
says: “I assert for myself that I do not behold the outward creation,
and that to me it is hindrance and not action. ‘What!’ it will be
questioned, ‘when the sun rises, do you not see a round disc of fire,
somewhat like a guinea?’ Oh! no! no! I see an innumerable
company of the heavenly host, crying, ‘Holy, holy, holy is the Lord
God Almighty!’ I question not my corporeal eye, any more than I
would question a window concerning a sight. I look through it, and
not with it.”</p>

<p>Blake’s conception of the sun may be compared with Dante’s vision
of the angels with the cloud:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Then lifting up mine eyes, as the tears came,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">I saw the Angels, like a rain of manna,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">In a long flight flying back heavenward;</div>
<div class="verse">Having a little cloud in front of them,</div>
<div class="verse indent1">After the which they went, and said, “Hosanna!”</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And if they had said more, you should have heard.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>An earlier acquaintance with Dante would undoubtedly have
exerted a great influence upon Blake.</p>

<p>Not the least interesting part of Blake’s catalogue is his description
of the pictures accompanying his <i>Canterbury Pilgrims</i>, which include the
strange patriotic allegories of <i>Nelson guiding Leviathan</i> and <i>Pitt guiding
Behemoth</i>, the latter of which is now in the National Gallery; <i>Satan
calling up his Legions</i>; <i>The Bard</i>, described by Rossetti as “a gorgeous
piece of colour tone”; an idyll, charming in conception whatever it may
have been in execution, representing goats nibbling the vine leaves that
form the sole drapery of savage maidens; and Arthur’s battle of Camlan,
whence only three&mdash;the strongest, the most beautiful, and the ugliest of
champions&mdash;escaped with their lives. This picture Seymour Kirkup
thought Blake’s best, and Allan Cunningham his worst. Kirkup, Mr.
Swinburne tells us, remembered to the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span> “the fury and splendour of
energy there contrasted with the serene ardour of simply beautiful
courage, the violent life of the design, and the fierce distance of
fluctuating battle.” Blake’s estimate of his powers, as conveyed in his
descriptions of his works, certainly does not err on the side of modesty;
perhaps he thought with Goethe that “Nur die Lumpen sind bescheiden.”
It is a more serious matter that the descriptions are crammed with
statements far more significant than Blake’s visions of a condition of
mental disorder, such as that the Greek marbles are copies of the works
of the Asiatic patriarchs; that no one painted in oil, except by accident,
before Vandyke; that ancient British heroes dwell to this day on
Snowdon “in naked simplicity”: a species of Welsh Mahatmas, as it
would appear. It would have been a judicious emendation if any one
had suggested the substitution of “lying spirits” when the artist spoke
of himself as “molested by blotting and blurring demons.”</p>

<p>More important than these idle extravagances, though extravagant
enough, are the annotations on Reynolds’s discourses, written a few years
afterwards. To read Blake’s abuse of this great artist with any patience,
one must remember that his expressions require to be translated out of
his peculiar dialect into ordinary speech; as when, for example, he says
that Correggio is a most effeminate and cruel demon, he only means that
he is a bad model for artists to follow. Yet there is a great and serious
truth lying at the bottom of Blake’s declamation, and his protest against
the apparent tendency of Reynolds to inculcate the feasibility of manufacturing
genius by study was not uncalled for. What he did not sufficiently
remember was that the number of artists capable of what Plato
calls divine insanity, must always be very small, and that Reynolds’s precepts
may be very serviceable for the rank and file of the great army.
As his denunciation of Reynolds was partly prompted by personal
grievances (not the less real, if the apparent paradox may be excused,
for being imaginary), it is the more to his honour to find him breaking
out into genuine admiration whenever, in Swedenborg’s phrase, the dry
rod blossoms as Reynolds affirms a truth. It is also pleasant to receive
Samuel Palmer’s assurance that Blake’s splenetic outbreaks in print
astonished those accustomed to his catholicity of criticism in conversation.</p>

</div>

<p>Very little is known of Blake’s life for several years after his exhibition.
William Carey, a rare example of disinterestedness among
picture-dealers, for he praised Blake enthusiastically without having dealt
with him, says in his exposition of West’s <i>Death on the Pale Horse</i>
(1817), “So entire is the uncertainty in which he is involved that after
many inquiries I meet with some in doubt whether he is still in existence.
But I have accidentally learned since I commenced these remarks that he
is now a resident in London.” He was, in fact, continuing to live on
his second floor in South Molton Street, poor, but content, subsisting
from day to day by hack work as an engraver, and the occasional
sale of a water-colour design or a coloured copy of one of his books,
but nowise squalid, abject, or destitute. He was no longer able to
publish on his own account as of old, and the poems which he continued
to produce abundantly, all of which have perished, met with
the reception which was to be expected from earthly publishers. Blake
smiled in pity, assured that, in his own figurative language, they were
handsomely printed and bound in heaven, and eagerly perused by
spiritual intelligences. “I should be sorry,” he afterwards said to
Crabb Robinson, “if I had any earthly fame, for whatever natural
glory a man has is so much taken from his spiritual glory.” He certainly
had not thought so when he published his catalogue; but there
is no question of his perfect sincerity when he added, “I wish to
do nothing for profit. I wish to live for art.” Though he had said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
“Thought is act: Christ’s acts were nothing to Cæsar’s if this is not so”;
so intense was his own devotion to labour that for two years he never
quitted his lodging, except (for the ridiculous will intrude where it is
not wanted&mdash;imps grin in the cells of anchorites&mdash;) for a pot of porter.
Even while he engraved he read, as the plate-marks on his books attest.
Flaxman, his steady friend from youth, found him some work in
engraving, and praised him in conversation. “But Blake’s a wild
enthusiast, isn’t he?” “Some think <i>me</i> an enthusiast,” answered Flaxman,
who was, in truth, more than half a Swedenborgian.</p>

<p>From this hermit’s existence Blake once more emerges, in 1818,
into comparative publicity through the intimacy he formed with a
young painter of promise, which he was destined to more than redeem.
This was John Linnell, who was introduced to him by Mr. George
Cumberland, of Bristol, an enlightened patron of art. At this time
Linnell was largely engaged in portrait painting, and the plate of the
portrait selected here for reproduction, that of Wilson Lowry, Esq.,
appears to have been worked upon by both him and Blake, bearing the
name of each. Linnell, though neither gentle nor mystical, lived much
in the world of the spirit, and, without sharing Blake’s peculiarities, was
rather attracted than repelled by them. Within a few days after making
Blake’s acquaintance he had found him work to the amount of fifteen
guineas, and gradually introduced him to patrons, including Sir Thomas
Lawrence, a great gentleman as well as a fine painter, who took the
notice of Blake which it became him to take in his position as President
of the Royal Academy. Blake never encountered hostility from artists
of true eminence. Reynolds advised him wisely, though he would not
think so. Lawrence patronised him; and Flaxman, Fuseli, Stothard,
Linnell were, so far as he permitted them, real friends. Within a few
years Linnell had introduced him to a younger circle, ready in a
measure to sit at his feet, and the rejected stone was honourably built
into the corner. Of these we shall have to speak afterwards, but one
important intimacy mainly belongs to the period of 1818-21. This
was his acquaintance with John Varley, famed as one of the fathers of
English water-colour painting, but even more renowned as an astrologer.
Indeed, some of the stories told of his successful predictions are less
startling to the uninitiated than to astrologers themselves, who cannot comprehend
on what principle of the art they could be made. They certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
were not arrived at by vision or revelation, for the good Varley was a
most unspiritual personage, the very antipodes of seer or anchorite, big,
sanguine, jovial, and everlastingly in the claws of the bailiffs. Astrology,
therefore, a study which, with all its fascination for an imaginative mind,
requires nothing but observation and calculation, was the only occult
science open to him; for magic, although a diabolical pursuit, occasionally
demands an amount of fasting inconvenient even for a saint. Varley
would have wished to go further, and finding the perception of visions
inconsistent with his own corporeal and spiritual constitution, was delighted
to make the acquaintance of one who to this end needed but to open
his eyes. He speedily developed the practical idea that Blake should
depict the spiritual entities which he beheld. Blake forthwith set to
work, and ere long the portfolios of Varley and Linnell were enriched
with those ghosts of fleas, portraits of Edward the Third, and men who
built the pyramids, which are better known to many than anything
he ever did, and are assuredly no mean examples of his imaginative power.
“All,” says Gilchrist, “are marked by a decisive portrait-like character,
and are evidently literal portraits of what Blake’s imaginative eye
beheld.”<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> This is corroborated by the account of Varley, who says,
“On hearing of this spiritual apparition of a Flea, I asked him
if he could draw for me the resemblance of what he saw. He instantly
said, ‘I see him now before me.’ I therefore gave him a paper and a
pencil, with which he drew the portrait of which a facsimile is given
in this number [of Varley’s <i>Zodiacal Physiognomy</i>]. I felt convinced by
his mode of proceeding that he had a real image before him; for he left
off and began on another part of the paper to make a separate drawing of
the mouth of the Flea, which the spirit having opened he was prevented
from proceeding with the first sketch till he had closed it.” It was “an
idea with the force of a sensation,” as Peacock’s philosopher classifies the
apparition in <i>Nightmare Abbey</i>. Shelley, who also saw visions, has
enriched his note-books with similar delineations of imaginary figures,
generally vague and careless, but sometimes very Blake-like. One of
Linnell’s most spirited studies from life, engraved in Story’s biography,
represents Blake and Varley in discussion.</p>

</div>

<p>These drawings were mostly executed in 1819 and 1820. In the
latter year Blake lost his chief patron Butts, whose walls, indeed, had
become so crowded with his works that he had almost ceased to give him
commissions. The greater part of the collection was dispersed in 1852,
but the zeal of Mr. W. M. Rossetti traced most of its constituents out,
and reference to his notes, printed in the second volume of Gilchrist’s
biography, will enable us to convey some faint notion of its manifold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
opulence. Putting the <i>Job</i> aside for the present, the most remarkable
appear to be the nine designs for <i>Paradise Lost</i>, the property of Mr.
J. C. Strange, in which, says Mr. Rossetti, Blake is king of all his powers
of design, draughtsmanship, conception, spiritual meaning, and impression.
Another set, belonging to Mr. Aspland, of Liverpool, omits one
subject and adds four. Another set of Miltonic designs for <i>Comus</i>,
rather distinguished by grace than grandeur, has been recently published
by Mr. Quaritch. Another set of no less than one hundred and eighteen
designs for Gray’s works, in 1860 in the possession of the Duke of
Hamilton, are reputed to rank among Blake’s finest productions, but
have not been inspected by any one competent to describe them. Among
others especially commended by Mr. Rossetti are <i>The Sacrifice of Jephthah’s
Daughter</i>, <i>Ruth</i>, <i>The Judgment of Paris</i>, <i>The Wise and Foolish Virgins</i>,
<i>Fire</i>, <i>Famine</i>, <i>Samson subdued</i>, <i>The Finding of Moses</i>, <i>Moses erecting
the Brazen Serpent</i>, <i>The Ghost of Samuel appearing to Saul</i>, <i>The Entombment</i>,
<i>The Sealing of the Sepulchre</i>, <i>The Angel rolling the Stone from the Sepulchre</i>,
<i>The River of Life</i>, and <i>Hecate</i>. To these may be added <i>The Resurrection
of the Dead</i>, now in the British Museum, reproduced by us. Many
others, not belonging to the Butts collection, are described with equal
enthusiasm; and, apart from all questions of technical execution, usually
splendid, but lost upon those who have not access to the original works,
it may be said that the conceptions, as described by Mr. Rossetti, would be
impossible to one unendowed with the highest artistic imagination, and
that the body is worthy of the spirit.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>The Resurrection of the Dead. From a water-colour drawing by W. Blake.

</div>

<p>Prominent among these designs are the set of illustrations to <i>Job</i>, now
the property of the Earl of Crewe. A duplicate set belonged to Mr.
Linnell, who, “discounting as it were,” says Gilchrist, “Blake’s bill on
posterity when no one else would,” commissioned this from him,
tracing the outlines from Butt’s copy himself, and handing them over
to Blake to complete. This was done in September, 1821, and when the
drawings were completed in 1823 Linnell went further still, and commissioned
Blake to engrave them, a stroke which has probably effected
more than anything else for the artist’s fame, for the drawings which have
set him on such a pinnacle, if unengraved, would have remained virtually
unknown to the world. The terms also were liberal. Blake was to
receive £100 for the twenty-two plates and £100 more out of the profits.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
When the publication barely covered its expenses, Linnell, reflecting that
the plates remained in his possession in virtue of the agreement, not
unreasonably but very handsomely allowed Blake £50 more. But for
this manna from heaven Blake’s last years would have been spent in
engraving pigs and poultry after Morland. Linnell, who was himself an
excellent engraver, further conferred an important benefit upon him
by making him acquainted with the best style of Italian engraving. Blake
proved a docile pupil at sixty-five, and his plates to <i>Job</i> are not only
technically the best he ever executed, but occupy an important place in
the history of the art.</p>

<p>The glory of <i>Job</i>, however, is not in the engraving, but in the invention,
which, beautiful in the soft and idyllic passages, rises into sublimity
when the theme appeals strongly to the creative imagination. It is especially
remarkable as being one of the very few instances of a worthy representation
of the Almighty. The tender humanities of Christian art are
absent: all is awful, Hebraic, and strictly monotheistic. Among the
most remarkable designs may be noted that where the exulting fiend pulls
down the mansion upon Job’s sons and daughters (reproduced here); the
frantic speed of the messenger of evil, who bursts out with his tale before
he is well within hearing, while another follows with equal haste hard
upon him, and the uninterested sheep graze on undisturbed; the terrible
scene where Satan, a figure repeated in essentials from works of earlier
date, smites the prostrate Job with sore boils; Eliphaz besieged with
phantoms, to all seeming not less real than himself (also given here); the
morning stars singing together; the downfall of the wicked; and the
Lord answering Job out of the whirlwind. Passages even of the less
striking designs often have a singular fascination, such as the night-piercing
stars in the Elihu scene, which would be impressive in the
absence of any human figure; Behemoth and Leviathan, the <i>ne plus ultra</i>
of grotesque grandeur, which we have also given; and the bowed backs
of Job’s accusing friends when the Lord blesses him.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> On the whole,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>though others of Blake’s designs may be more transcendent of ordinary
human faculty, he has scarcely executed anything displaying all his faculties
so well combined and in such perfect equilibrium; and, were it necessary
to rest his fame upon one set of works, this would probably be selected.
As a scriptural theme it appealed with especial strength to English
sympathies, and having been selected by Gilchrist for reproduction, it is
more widely known than any of his works except the illustrations to Blair’s
<i>Grave</i>. “The original water-colour designs,” Rossetti says, “are much
larger than the engravings, and generally pale in colour, with a less full
and concentrated effect than the engravings, and by no means equal
to them in power and splendid decorative treatment of the light and
shade. On the other hand, they are often completer and naturally freer
in expression, and do not exhibit a certain tendency to over-sturdiness of
build and physiognomy in the figures.” Fine as is the figure of Satan in
<i>The Destruction of Job’s Sons and Daughters</i>, it is, Mr. Rossetti thinks,
much finer in the water colour. On the other hand, “the effect of sublimity
and multitude in <i>When the morning stars sang together</i> is centupled in
the engraving by adding the upraised arms of two other angels to right and
left, passing out of the composition.” The whole account suggests how
desirable it would be to have many of Blake’s unpublished water colours
translated into black and
white, could engraver or
etcher of the needful force
be found.</p>

<p class="caption"><i>Woodcut from Thornton’s Pastoral.</i></p>

</div>

<p>In 1821 Blake had
performed another work
of moment, his first and
last wood-engravings.
These were to illustrate
Phillips’s imitation of
Virgil’s first pastoral, republished by Dr. Thornton, a physician and
botanist. Blake was a novice in this branch of art, and the cuts answer
to Dr. Thornton’s own description of them: “They display less of art
than of genius.” But nothing could more effectually confirm the principle
enunciated by their critic in the <i>Athenæum</i>:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span> “Amid all drawbacks there
exists a power in the work of the man of genius which no one but himself
can utter fully.” Rude as they are, their force is extraordinary; few
things can be more truly magical than the glimpse of distant sea in the
second of those engraved by Gilchrist. At the same time they are not
in the least Virgilian, and in this respect form an instructive contrast
with the exquisite though unfinished Virgilian illustrations of Samuel
Palmer. Palmer, though putting in a cypress now and then as a tribute
to <i>couleur locale</i>, provides Virgil substantially with the same style of
illustration as he had been producing all his life for other ends, and yet
this seems as appropriate to the text as Blake’s is discrepant. It is interesting
to speculate what effect an Italian residence of two or three years,
such as Palmer had enjoyed, would have produced upon Blake beyond
the inevitable one of dissipating his monstrous delusions about Italian
artists. He would probably have gone chiefly with the view of studying
Michael Angelo, but we suspect that the influences of Italian landscape
would in the long run have proved fully as potent.</p>

<p>In 1821 Blake removed from South Molton Street to Fountain
Court, Strand, near the Savoy, where he occupied two rooms on the first
floor. The reason may have been that the house was kept by a brother-in-law
of Mrs. Blake’s named Baines, the only trace we have of any connection
with his wife’s family. Economy too may have had its influence;
his means were very low, not yet improved by the donation of £25 he
received from the Academy next year, or his arrangement with Linnell in
the year following. At the worst, however, the rooms were always clean
and neat, thanks to Mrs. Blake’s industry and devotion; and Blake’s
manner always had the simplicity and dignity of a gentleman. That his
circumstances improved was almost entirely the doing of Linnell, who
not only provided for his wants by commissions, but made him what his
genius had never made him, the patriarch of a band of admirers, almost
disciples. Coming frequently to visit Linnell at Hampstead, Blake fell
in with a group of young men who resorted thither, four of whom at
least&mdash;Samuel Palmer, Edward Calvert, George Richmond, and F. O.
Finch&mdash;became artists of great distinction. One characteristic these
young men had in common: they were as far as possible from the
theory of art for art’s sake, but only valued art as the outward and visible
sign of the inward and spiritual grace of consecration to the Power behind
Nature. The biographies of Palmer and Calvert disclose the priestlike<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
spirit in which they wrought, a spirit akin to that of their pre-Raphaelite
successors, but apparently less impregnated with the ordinary atmosphere
of the studio. These were just the men to treat the aged Blake as the
antediluvian youth ought to have treated the aged Jubal; and the
patriarchal influence is visible both in their writings and their works, not
always to the advantage of the latter, if we may judge by the examples<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
preserved of Palmer’s early labours. But all seemed fair in the light of
fond retrospect. Twenty-eight years after Blake’s death Samuel Palmer
addressed a letter to Mr. Gilchrist, long and full of interesting particulars
relating to Blake’s opinions on art; but the gist of the estimate of
the man is conveyed in few words. “In him you saw at once the Maker,
the Inventor; one of the few in any age; a fitting companion for Dante.
He was energy itself, and shed around him a kindling influence, an
atmosphere of life, full of the ideal. He was a man without a mask; his
aim single, his path straightforwardness, and his wants few; so he was
free, noble, and happy.”</p>

<p>A very important witness to Blake’s demeanour and opinions in his
later years is Henry Crabb Robinson the diarist, whom we have already
met as a visitor to Blake’s exhibition, and who had made him the subject
of an essay in a German periodical. Robinson was the right man in the
right place, not being a mystic or enthusiast to fall down at Blake’s feet,
nor yet a man of the world to deride him as a visionary, but an inquisitive
observer of great intellectual range and most kindly and tolerant disposition,
ready to allow that things might exist of which his philosophy
had not dreamed, and whom abnormal opinions, if held in evident
sincerity, might startle but could hardly shock. “It is strange,” says he,
“that I who have no imagination, nor any power beyond that of a logical
understanding, should yet have a great respect for religious mystics.”
Thrown into Blake’s company in 1825, he has recorded his conversations
with him at considerable length in his delightful diary, as yet but
partially published. His description of Blake’s “interesting appearance”
agrees with that of his own circle. “He is pale, with a Socratic countenance,
and an expression of great sweetness, though with something of
languor about it except when animated, and then he has about him an
air of inspiration. The tone and manner are incommunicable. There
are a natural sweetness and gentility about him which are delightful.”
Having heard of Blake’s visions, Robinson was not surprised to find him
asserting that the visionary gift was innate in all men, and only torpid
for want of cultivation; but he must have had much ado to digest such
statements as that the world was flat, that Wordsworth was a Pagan, and
that “what are called the vices in the natural world are the highest
sublimities in the spiritual world.” Not understanding that by atheism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Blake meant, in his own words, “whatever assumes the reality of the
natural and unspiritual world,” Robinson was naturally aghast when Locke
was classed with atheists, and ventured what must have appeared to him
the conclusive rejoinder that Locke had written in defence of Christianity.
Blake, who probably understood Robinson’s definition of atheism
as little as Robinson did his, “made no reply.” Some of Blake’s remarks
are well worthy of preservation. “Art is inspiration. When Michael
Angelo, or Raphael, or Mr. Flaxman does any of his fine things, he does
them in the spirit.” “Irving is a <i>sent</i> man. But they who are sent go
further sometimes than they ought.” “Dante saw devils where I see
none.”</p>

</div>

<p>Dante must have been much in Blake’s thoughts just then, for
Robinson found him occupied with the long series of illustrations of the
poet commissioned by Linnell, the last important work of his life. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
history of the commission is thus related by Linnell’s biographer, Mr.
Story. “Although the <i>Job</i> had been paid for, Linnell continued to
give him money weekly. Blake said, ‘I do not know how I shall ever
repay you.’ Linnell replied, ‘I do not want you to repay me. I am
only too glad to be able to serve you. What I would like, however, if
you do anything for me, is that you should make some designs for
Dante’s <i>Inferno</i>, <i>Purgatorio</i>, and <i>Paradiso</i>.’ Blake entered upon the
work with alacrity, concurrently with the engraving of the <i>Job</i>
designs, and the two together occupied the old man for the rest of his
life.” During all this period Linnell was remitting Blake money,
as the latter’s notes in acknowledgment prove. Linnell undoubtedly
acquired the designs at a low price, but immediately upon Blake’s death
he endeavoured to dispose of them for the benefit of the widow. Failing
in this he kept them, never attempting to make anything by them; and
they are still in the possession of his family.</p>

<p>Blake studied Italian to qualify himself more effectually for his task,
and is said to have acquired it; when Robinson saw him, however, at
an early stage of the commission it is true, he was working by the
aid of Cary’s English version. He executed no less than ninety-eight
drawings, several of which were left in an unfinished state. Seven have
been engraved. The merits of the series have been variously estimated.
Mr. Rossetti considers them “on the whole a very fine series, though not
uniformly equal in merit.” Mr. Yeats, so well qualified by his own
imaginative gift to enter into the merit of Blake’s work, thinks them the
finest of all his productions. Robinson, who saw Blake at work upon
them, says, “They evince a power I should not have anticipated of
grouping, and of throwing grace and interest over conceptions monstrous
and horrible.” For our own part, we must regretfully admit that when
we saw them at the Old Masters’ exhibition the monstrosity and horror
appeared more evident than the grace and interest. We could not deem
Dante’s conceptions adequately rendered; the colour, too, often seemed
harsh and extravagant. Blake went on working upon them until his
death, when Mrs. Blake sent them to Linnell. They thus escaped the
fate of Blake’s other artistic and literary remains left in his widow’s
possession, which after her death were appropriated, apparently without
any legal authority, by a person named Tatham, who had been much about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Blake in his later years, and who ultimately destroyed them in deference
to the mandate of a religious sect with which he had become connected!<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>The end was now near. During 1827 Blake’s health greatly failed
from catarrh and dysentery, and he could no longer go up to Hampstead
to see Linnell. Linnell wished him to quit the damp neighbourhood of
the river, and live in his own house in Cirencester Place, part only of
which he used as a studio. But Blake said, “I cannot get my mind out
of a state of terrible fear at such a step.” He also said, “I am too much
attached to Dante to think much of anything else.” One of his last
works was the colouring of <i>The Ancient of Days</i> for the elder Tatham,
who paid him at a higher rate than he was accustomed to receive. Blake
accordingly worked his hardest, and when it was finished “threw it from
him, and with an air of exulting triumph exclaimed, ‘There, that will
do, I cannot mend it.’” Later still he exclaimed to his wife, “You have
ever been an angel to me, I will draw you,” and produced a sketch,
“interesting, but not like.” On August 12 he died, “composing and
uttering songs to his Maker.” He was buried in Bunhill Fields, in a
grave which cannot now be identified. It is little to the honour of his
countrymen that no public memorial of him should exist. A better one
could not be than his own <i>Death’s Door</i> in the illustration to Blair’s
<i>Grave</i>, treated as a bas-relief with the necessary modifications.</p>

<p>The artist whose life had been spent in a condition so little remote
from penury did not leave a single debt, and the accumulated stock
of his works sufficed to support his widow in comfort for the four years
for which she survived him. Friends, indeed, aided, Linnell and Tatham
successively giving her house-room, and others assiduously recommending
her stores of drawings to wealthy patrons. She died in Upper Charlotte
Street, Fitzroy Square, and was buried beside her husband in Bunhill
Fields.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The artistic processes used by Blake are a subject of considerable
discussion. Notwithstanding his constant description of his pictures as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
“frescoes,” it seems certain that he never resorted to fresco in the
ordinary acceptation of the term. Linnell, who must have been exceedingly
familiar with his work, told Mr. Gilchrist: “He evidently founded
his claim to the name fresco on the material he used, which was water-colour
on a plaster ground (literally glue and whiting); but he always
called it either fresco, gesso, or plaster.” Linnell added that when he
himself obtained from Italy the first copy that ever came to England of
Cennino Cennini’s <i>Trattato della Pittura</i>, a sixteenth-century treatise, edited
in 1822 from the original MS., Blake, who was soon able to read it, “was
gratified to find that he had been using the same materials and methods
in painting as Cennini describes, particularly the carpenter’s glue.” “Unfortunately,”
says Linnell, “he laid this ground on too much like
plaster to a wall,” and when this was so applied to canvas or linen the
picture was sure to crack, and many of Blake’s best works have suffered
great injury. Oil he disliked and vituperated. The reason probably was
that, contrary to what might have been expected, his system of execution
was by no means bold and dashing, but deliberate and even slow. He
drew a rough dotted line with pencil, then with ink, then colour, filling
in cautiously and carefully. All the grand efforts of design, he thought,
depended on niceties not to be got at once. He seems, in fact, to have
worked very much in the spirit of the mediæval illuminators, and the
general aspect of a page of one of his Prophetical Books reminds us
forcibly of one of their scrolls. Whether any direct influence from them
upon him is traceable would be difficult to determine. Keats had
evidently seen illuminated manuscripts, and been deeply impressed by
them; but nearly forty years elapsed between the publication of the first
of Blake’s Prophetical Books and the composition of Keats’s <i>Eve of St.
Mark</i>. In one respect Blake certainly differed from the ancient miniaturists;
he wrought mainly from reminiscence, and disliked painting with
his eye on the object. His memory for natural forms must have been
very powerful.</p>

<p>Blake is endowed in a very marked degree with the interest ascribed
by Goethe to <i>Problematische Naturen</i>, men who must always remain
more or less of a mystery to their fellows. In ancient times, and perhaps
in some countries at the present day, he would have been accepted as
a seer; in his own age and country the question was rather whether he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
should be classed with visionaries or with lunatics. A visionary he
certainly was, and few will believe either that his visions had any
objective reality, or that he himself intended them to be received merely
as symbols. “You can see what I do, if you choose,” he said to his
friends. He thus confused fancy with fact; unquestionably, therefore,
he laboured under delusions. But delusions do not necessarily amount to
insanity, and, however Blake erred in form, it may be doubted whether
in essentials he was not nearer the truth than most so-called poets and
artists. Every poet and artist worthy of the name will confess that his
productions, when really good for anything, are the suggestion of a power
external to himself, of an influence which he may to a certain extent
guide, but cannot originate or summon up at his will; and in the absence
of which he is helpless. In personifying this influence as the Muse, or
howsoever he may prefer to describe it, such an one is usually fully aware
that, in obedience to a law of the human mind, he is bestowing personality
and visibility upon what is actually invisible and impersonal, but not
on that account unreal. Some there are, however, whose perceptions are
so lively, or their power of dealing with abstractions so limited, that the
mental influences of which they are conscious appear to them in the
light of personalities. Such was Blake, and the peculiarity in him was
probably closely connected with the childlike disposition which rendered
him so amiable as a man. As a child it naturally never occurred to him
to question the reality of his visions, and he grew up without acquiring
the critical habit of mind which would have led him to do so. With him
“the vision splendid” did <i>not</i></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent10">Die away,</div>
<div class="verse">And fade into the light of common day.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Such a state of mind is quite compatible with sanity. The question is
not whether the person</p>

<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent4">Gives to airy nothings</div>

<p class="noindent">but whether he allows his conduct to be actuated by them to the extent
of inverting the rules of right and wrong, wasting his substance, or becoming
offensive to others or dangerous to himself. It is even possible
to travel far in this direction without arriving at the confines of insanity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Prince Polignac brought the monarchy of the Restoration to ruin in
deference to imaginary revelations from the Virgin Mary, yet no court
of law would ever have placed him under restraint. With Blake not the
faintest suggestion of such a thing is possible. Except for one or
two incidents, related upon doubtful authority, he appears throughout
his life in the light of an exemplary citizen, and in his unselfishness
and unworldliness contrasts with his Sadducæan neighbours in a way that
forbids us to call him mentally diseased, though he may have been
mentally warped. The value of his mystical utterances is quite another
question. The occasional splendour of the poetry in which they are
couched will not be disputed, any more than their general confusion and
obscurity. Commentators have striven hard to elicit the sunbeam from
the cucumber; we pass no judgment on their efforts, further than may
seem to be implied in the observation that in our opinion the chief
mission of Blake’s mystical poetry was to be the vehicle of his finest and
most characteristic art. His ideas, many profound and worthy of close
attention, may, we think, be more advantageously collected from his
prose aphorisms and the fragments of his conversation; and in this
respect he is by no means singular. The one great achievement which
unquestionably entitles him to the distinction of an inspired man, is to
have produced in boyhood, without set purpose or any clear consciousness
of what he was doing, lyrics recalling the golden prime of English poetry,
and instinct with a music to which, since Chatterton was no more, no
contemporary save Burns was capable of making the slightest approach.
It is true that reaction against artifice and conventionality was in the air
of the time, and was already announced by evident symptoms. To compare,
however, the highly creditable efforts in this direction of even such
poets as Cowper and Mickle with the achievements of this stripling is to
become sensible at once of the difference between talent and inspiration.</p>

<p>Blake’s gifts and shortcomings as an artist are sufficiently revealed
by the examples of his work which accompany this essay. It need merely
be remarked here that, apart from the great army of artists of genius who
move on recognised lines, transmitting the succession from the age of
Zeuxis and Phidias to our own, there is, as it were, a parallel column
skirting it on the by-roads of art; and that at certain periods of Art’s
history the genius which has forsaken the more conspicuous of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
manifestations has seemed to take refuge with etchers, or designers, or
delineators of the life of the people. It has frequently happened of late
that men whose work was chiefly done for books and periodicals, and who
during their lives were scarcely regarded as artists at all, have upon their
deaths been deservedly exalted to very high places. Blake is perhaps the
most striking and remarkable example of this class.</p>

<p>Blake’s peculiarities as a man, and the anecdotes of which he became
the subject, secured him earlier attention as artist and poet than his
works would have obtained on their own account. Not long after his
death he was made (1830) the subject of one of Allan Cunningham’s
<i>Lives of British Painters</i>, in the main a fair and impartial biography,
rather in advance of than behind its time. Cunningham, however,
possessed no sort of spiritual kinship with Blake, who found his first
really congenial commentator in a veteran philosopher, still happily
spared to us, Dr. James Garth Wilkinson, who in 1839, the year
of the first collected edition of Shelley’s poems, republished <i>Songs of
Innocence and Experience</i> with an anonymous preface claiming for Blake
something like his proper position as a lyric poet, and accompanied by
judicious remarks upon his paintings. Dr. Wilkinson would probably
have expressed himself still more decidedly if he had written a few years
later, but the movement towards the exaltation of the more spiritual
aspects of English poetry as typified in Wordsworth and Shelley was as
yet but incipient, and the stars of Tennyson and Browning were hardly
above the horizon. Little further seems to have been done for Blake,
until, about 1855, the late Mr. Alexander Gilchrist began to write his
biography, published in 1862, a labour of love and diligence which will
never be superseded, especially since the revision it has received in the
definitive edition of 1880, brought out by his widow. The value of
Gilchrist’s labours is greatly enhanced by the accompanying illustrations,
which allow a fairly adequate conception to be formed of Blake’s pictorial
genius, by the reprint of much of his most characteristic literary work, and
by the copious descriptions of his drawings by Mr. W. M. Rossetti and Mr.
F. Shields. Since Gilchrist wrote, Mr. Swinburne (1868) has investigated
Blake’s thought with special reference to its Pantheistic tendency,
and Messrs. Ellis and Yeats, in a most comprehensive work in three
volumes (1891), including additional biographical particulars and copious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
illustrations, which comprise the previously unpublished “Vala,” have
striven to present Blake’s mysticism as a coherent system of thought.
Valuable monographs are also prefixed to the editions of Blake’s poems
by Rossetti (1883) and Yeats (1893), and to the selection from his
literary works by Mr. Housman (1893), this last perhaps on the whole,
after Gilchrist’s biography, the most desirable possession for the literary
student of Blake. Of the numerous detached essays upon Blake the
most important, perhaps, are that by the late Mr. Smetham, republished
in his Essays, and in the second volume of Gilchrist’s biography, and that
by James Thomson, author of <i>The City of Dreadful Night</i>, appended
to his <i>Shelley, a Poem</i> (1884).</p>

<p>It is exceedingly difficult to obtain a proper idea of Blake as an artist,
from the extent to which his designs depend upon colouring, and the great
inequality of this colouring, which is often not his own. In Mr. Gilchrist’s
opinion, the copy of <i>The Song of Los</i>, in the Print Room of the
British Museum, and a volume of miscellaneous designs, in the same
collection, represent him with adequate fairness; and these fortunately
are public property. The finest specimens of his work seen by his biographer
are apparently in the collection of the Earl of Crewe, and therefore
not generally accessible. Those belonging to private collectors must
of necessity be continually changing hands, and few students have the
time or the opportunity to make the thorough investigation of them
accomplished by Mr. Rossetti. Fortunately the illustrations in Gilchrist’s
biography, where the whole of the <i>Job</i> series is reissued, suffice to
establish Blake’s genius as a designer, even though destitute of the
charm of colour. Mr. Bell Scott has executed effective etchings after
him; Mr. Quaritch has republished the drawings for <i>Comus</i>; in 1876 the
<i>Songs of Innocence and Experience</i> and the Prophetic Books up to <i>Los</i>
were reprinted together, but only to the extent of a hundred copies, nor
was the execution very satisfactory. It cannot be said that Messrs. Ellis
and Yeats have entirely overcome the difficulties of reproduction; yet,
perhaps, for those unable to obtain access to the copies tinted by the
artist, or even to the uncoloured plates in the original edition, nothing so
well displays the wilder and more weird aspects of his genius as the
reprints in their third volume, especially those from <i>Jerusalem</i>.</p>

<p>Blake’s character and works will long remain the subject of criticism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and speculation, for the world does not easily forgo its interest in what
Goethe calls “problematic natures.” By another famous saying of
Goethe’s he cannot profit, “He who has sufficed his own age has sufficed
all ages,” nor can he be reckoned among those who have been in advance
of their age, except in those exquisite early songs which died away before
the actual arrival of the better time. But it would not be too much to
say of him that he revealed possibilities, both in poetry and painting,
which without him we should hardly have suspected, and which remain
an unexhausted seed-field of inspiration for his successors. It is labour
lost to strive to make him transparent, but even where he is most
opaque</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_7" id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> Not always without assistance from the eyes of others; for the portrait of Edward
the First is clearly a reminiscence of that which in Blake’s time adorned Goldsmith’s
History.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> It is observable that Job’s wife, so disadvantageously treated in Scripture, is by Blake
represented as the sufferer’s loving companion throughout. This was probably out of
tenderness to Mrs. Blake, from whom, indeed, upon a comparison between her portrait
as a young woman and the ideal representation of the Patriarch’s spouse, his model for
the latter would seem to have been derived; but if so the inference seems justified that
Blake regarded the story of Job as emblematic of his own history.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_9" id="Footnote_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> It must be now about thirty-five years since we received a visit from this person;
how he had found us out we cannot recollect. He stated that he had lived by painting
miniatures, and, having been deprived of his customers by photography, proposed to
devote himself to historical painting, to the great prospective advantage of British art.
He considered his forte to be the delineation of bare arms, and wished to be recommended
to a subject which would afford scope for the exercise of this department of
the pictorial faculty. We suggested the interment of the young princes in the Tower;
he thanked us and departed; and we saw no more of him. He admitted having
parted with all the relics of Blake that had been in his possession, but sought to convey
that they had been sold, not destroyed, which may be partly true.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
